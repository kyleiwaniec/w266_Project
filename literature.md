The Sequential Analysis of Group Interaction and Critical Thinking in Online Threaded Discussions
The purpose of this study was to examine group interaction and critical
thinking in online threaded discussions. The Discussion Analysis
Tool (DAT) was used to identify patterns in interactions and determine
which interactions promoted critical thinking. With DAT,
discussion transcripts were coded across twelve critical thinking
events, and transitional probabilities between events were computed
using the method of sequential analysis (Bakeman and Quera 1995).
By computing the transitional probabilities, DAT generated useful
quantitative descriptions of interaction patterns and critical thinking
events that followed. The findings show that interactions involving
conflicting viewpoints promoted more discussion and critical thinking,
and that evaluation of arguments was more likely to occur as
conclusions were being drawnâ€”not as arguments were being presented.
Tools such as DAT will be useful for empirically testing interactions
and structures that enhance online discussions, providing
the basis for more systematic testing of instructional interventions
and computer-conferencing technologies.
