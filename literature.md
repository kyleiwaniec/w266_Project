[The Sequential Analysis of Group Interaction and Critical Thinking in Online Threaded Discussions](http://myweb.fsu.edu/ajeong/pubs/Jeong2003SequentialAnalysisInCMC.pdf)   
The purpose of this study was to examine group interaction and critical
thinking in online threaded discussions. The Discussion Analysis
Tool (DAT) was used to identify patterns in interactions and determine
which interactions promoted critical thinking. With DAT,
discussion transcripts were coded across twelve critical thinking
events, and transitional probabilities between events were computed
using the method of sequential analysis (Bakeman and Quera 1995).
By computing the transitional probabilities, DAT generated useful
quantitative descriptions of interaction patterns and critical thinking
events that followed. The findings show that interactions involving
conflicting viewpoints promoted more discussion and critical thinking,
and that evaluation of arguments was more likely to occur as
conclusions were being drawn—not as arguments were being presented.
Tools such as DAT will be useful for empirically testing interactions
and structures that enhance online discussions, providing
the basis for more systematic testing of instructional interventions
and computer-conferencing technologies.


[Automated Essay Scoring Using Machine Learning](http://nlp.stanford.edu/courses/cs224n/2013/reports/song.pdf)   
(Stanford student paper on the Kaggle dataset)   

We built an automated essay scoring system
to score approximately 13,000 essay from an
online Machine Learning competition Kaggle.com.
There are 8 different essay topics
and as such, the essays were divided into 8
sets which differed significantly in their responses
to the our features and evaluation.
Our focus for this essay grading was the style
of the essay, which is an extension on the
studies conducted determining the quality of
scientific articles by adding maturity to the
feature set (Louis and Nenkova, 2013). An
aspect of this project was to recognize the difference
between the advanced nature of scientific
articles to the coherency of middle to
high school test essays. We evaluated Linear
Regression, Regression Tree, Linear Discriminant
Analysis, and Support Vector Machines
on our features and discovered that
Regression Trees achieved the best results
with κ = 0.52.







[Using data mining as a strategy for assessing asynchronous discussion forums](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131504000788)   
(A quantitative approach using structured data - not individual qualitative assessments, but very useful for the big picure )

The purpose of this paper is to show how data mining may offer promise as a strategy for discovering and building alternative representations for the data underlying asynchronous discussion forums. Presently, the instructor's view of the output of a threaded forum is limited to reviewing a transcript or print version of the written dialogue produced by participants. With potentially hundreds of contributions to review for an entire online course, the instructor lacks a comprehensive view of the information embedded in the transcript. In this context, the authors attempt to sort out the question, “what is data from an online forum?” among other key questions. The present work seeks to intersect the information (i.e., participation indicators) an instructor may wish to extract from the forum with viewable and useful information that the system could produce from the instructor's query. Temporal participation indicators are used to show how using data and text mining techniques in the query process could improve the instructor's ability to evaluate the progress of a threaded discussion.
