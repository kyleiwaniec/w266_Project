Possible Data Sources:   
https://www.kaggle.com/c/asap-aes (from the automated essay scoring competition)   
~2,000 untagged posts from several recent courses on the topic of Cyber Security. I have a commitment from work that faculty and mentors will label some portion of this data to use as a test set.
