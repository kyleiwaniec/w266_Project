4932,16,CA,"<p><b>Due: Wednesday, April 27 by 11:59PM</b></p><p>For this final assignment, students will utilize all they have learned in the previous weeks of the cyberinternship to analyze the scenario and assigned case study.  As a reminder,the assumptions of the scenario are as follows:</p><p>Goliath National Bank (GNB) has developed and tested an electronic-trading system over the past 2 years, investing approximately $30 million in the people, processes, and technologies to support a state-of-the-art e-trading system and challenge market leaders.  </p><p>Recently, key components of GNB’s trading algorithms have surfaced on the dark web. A GNB employee is suspected, but it is unknown how the infrastructure and data were compromised.  In addition, the security operations center has disseminated several reports over the past few     months indicating that the financial industry is being targeted by sophisticated threat actors capable of employing blended attacks, including exploiting technical vulnerabilities and human intelligence sources.</p><p>Senior management has identified the e-trading system as critical to the future of GNB and expressed concerns that thee-trading system has created opaque risk to the firm.</p><p><b>Case study 1:Fraud</b></p><p>A lead software developer at GNB devised a scheme by which he skimmed fractions of points off of transactions and compensated discrepancies by manipulating e-trading ledgers.   He funneled the fractions of points into an account in his father-in-law’s name.   Ultimately,he was able to accumulate approximately $300,000 over a 6 month period.</p><p><b>Case Study 2: ITSabotage</b></p><p>GNB employed a contractor as a night time security guard who was heavily involved on the dark web and led a hacker-for-hire group.   The security guard was hired to disable GNB’s networks for a specified period of time.  He used his security key to obtain physical access to the server closet that housed the e-trading system.  Leveraging various types of malware, he rendered the GNB network infrastructure unstable, eventually leading to a four hour outage across the enterprise.   </p><p><b>Case Study 3: Theft of Intellectual Property</b></p><p>China sought to develop a next generation trading platform for brokers and dealers.   China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) targeted the technology (design and code) developed by GNB.  A contractor (development manager) who had spent 15 years with GNB used her privileged position to help the PLA.   The financial impact of this incident is significant and includes the subsequent loss of competitive advantage for the firm.</p><p><b>Case Study 4: Espionage</b></p><p>A former senior financial analyst was arrested as he was boarding a flight for Switzerland carrying a large amount of sensitive GNB data.   Computers searched in his home led to the discovery of emails offering to sell e-trading secrets to the highest bidder.   He often complained to former coworkers and neighbors about his job.</p><p><b>GNB profile:</b></p><ol><li>Industry: Financial Services</li><li>Headquarters: New York, NY</li><li>Size: 50,000 employees (not including subsidiaries, affiliates, or joint ventures)</li><li>Scale: Global, operating in 90+ countries across Americas, APAC, EMEA and LATAM either directly or indirectly (via subsidiaries, affiliates or joint ventures) <br/></li></ol><p><b>GNB network topology:</b><br/></p><p><a href=""http://prod.iq4.com/servlet/aws/GNB.png?r=342/F/2921/1/GNB.png&amp;a=inline""><img src=""http://prod.iq4.com/servlet/aws/GNB.png?r=342/F/2921/1/GNB.png&amp;a=inline""/></a><br/></p><p><b>Mission</b></p><p>GNB’s Information Risk Management teams will create an outline of a risk assessment for the e-trading system.  Risk assessments will identify key people,processes, and technologies at GNB and help senior management make critical business decisions to appropriately manage risk at the firm.  Identifying vulnerabilities, detecting current threats, protecting against threats, responding to compromises, and recovering operations is fundamental to sound IT Risk Management.  </p><p>Information Risk Management teams consist of five functional groups across GNB, including Information Risk Officers,Behavioral Analysts, Cyber Threat Analysts, Compliance Analysts, and IT Risk Analysts.  Groups will work together to conduct research, gather information, and leverage resources effectively to provide critical input and support individual team requirements.</p><p>In response to a request from the Board of Directors, Information Risk Management teams will provide senior management with an outline of a risk assessment for the e-trading system and present a comprehensive insider threat management program leveraging the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, industry best practices, and other relevant guidance.</p><p>Don’t forget to describe the anatomy of the attack. Teams should also ensure that the answers to the following questions are provided in their presentation: </p><ol><li>What happened? </li><li>Why did it happen?</li><li>How was the attack discovered?</li><li>What made this attack possible?</li><li>How can this attack be prevented?</li><li>What policies and measures were in place at the time of the incident?</li><li>What actions were taken following the detection of the incident?</li><li>How did you respond to the insider threat?</li><li>How did you recover from it?</li><li>What were the lessons learned? </li></ol><p><b><i>Guidelines</i>. </b>Students should closely examine the scenario. In particular, take note of discrepancies, discontinuities, anything that seems askew, out-of-place, questionable, or “unimportant.”  List any and all, and then begin to develop preliminary thoughts regarding these various fragmentary pieces of “shadow data.”  Consider, longer-range, how such marginal and soft data could have value to both resolution and pre-emption alongside conventional hard data analysis.</p><p>Also, consider who the various players are.  One is clearly identified but there are certainly others.  Not all are in the present; historical influences have ripple-effects.  Delineate all the individuals you would consider to have had some bearing on the planning and ultimate execution of the scenario; what roles each played both wittingly and/or unthinkingly; what information you might want to learn given the opportunity to interview them(consider in addition how you might best accomplish this) and, relatedly, how the aggregate of this nature of intelligence might be useful both in resolving this situation and also developing mitigation protocols over the horizon.</p><p><b><i>Action needed</i>: </b>Cyberinterns will be required to modify their PowerPoint presentation based on the feedback they received.

5198,0,CC,"<p style="""">Right answer, but let me get to that a little later..</p>
<p style="""">Let me begin with a quote from<span>&nbsp;</span><span style="""">Bruce Schneier&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<i><b><b>&quot;If you think technology can solve your security problems, then you don't understand the problems and you don't understand the technology.&quot;&nbsp;</b></b></i></p>
<p style="""">This&nbsp;is&nbsp;especially&nbsp;true when we are talking about Insider Threat , You will hear a lot from all mentors about the human behavioral aspect of insider threat.. let me warn you you will be tempted to start with &nbsp;tools and products to solve the problem.. While technology has a great role, you need to realize that blindly throwing more technology at a technology created problem is not always a good strategy.</p>
<p style="""">This brings me to my favorite quotes on problem solving.. from none other than Albert Einstein..</p>
<p style=""""><i>&quot;If I had an hour to solve a problem I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions.&rdquo; </i>&nbsp;Let's take &nbsp;few minutes to understand the root cause of the EPIC challenge problem that is given to you..<br /></p>
<p style="""">While &nbsp;Olduvai stone technology (Olduwan) from about 2.5 million years ago , if you consider Homo erectus as the first version of the Homo Sapien then Fire would be the first technology invented about 1.5 million years ago..Now while fire has warmed humans, cooked food for them , it was also used to burn houses, burn people on stakes, and kill people and harm people. Human evilness existed ever since man started walking on the planet..&nbsp;</p>
<p style="""">Hence we need to understand that <b>Human Evilness Cannot be Eliminated</b>.. &nbsp;But there is a subtle difference with other animals in the natural world: humans do evil things not for survival, but pleasure and other unknown reasons.To understand why an employee or an insider turn evil and decide to bite the hand that feeds him, is something that need some thinking before we start this course, Human Behavior both with a malicious intend and non malicious intend will be the main subject of this course, and the processes, tools and techniques for early detection, response to the evil intend of an insider is something that you will be learning and developing in the next 12 weeks.<br /></p>

<p>&nbsp;Let me give you some &nbsp;numbers.. in a analysis of million insider incidents, it was found that only 1% of insiders have malicious intent and either shown &nbsp;a clear intention to act on it and acted on it.. (The Clear and Present Doctrine adopted by US Supreme court in First Amendment Cases could be a good model, since we have some privacy and freedom issues that we will talk later in the class)..

5212,0,CC,"<p>Gopal launched this thread by asking about the first human technology.  The replies focused on original tools in terms of tangible objects or mechanisms -- stone implements, wheels, or harnessing fire, etc.</p>
<p>The discussion has now begun to develop broader contours and, specifically, includes not just technology but also people.As it is still early in the term, it's important to start elaborating additional perspectives with greater depth and detail.</p>
<p>I would like you to consider the idea of the human mind as a tool (or technology) in itself.  It could be argued that a proto-understanding by one individual to manipulate, coerce, or intimidate others to follow his lead or command (or whim!) qualifies as being the first human technology.</p>
<p>Early civilizations were communities of individuals.  While much has changed over the millennia, from socio-anthropological and depth psychological vantage points, many of the shifts to today's communities are not terribly huge.  If you follow the current news from around the world, parse out the particulars regarding here and now, it's not hard to imagine that we're hearing about the same sorts of activities, with adjustments to time, place, and culture, that have bedeviled humanity in various forms since the dawn of time.</p>
<p>Fire can be used to cook, heat, or provide light; it's also the tool of the arsonist or a weapon for territorial incursion, wanton destruction, or used by one group to gain advantage over another.  Even before there was spoken language (or codified systems for conceptualizing and governing language), early people surely experienced most or many of the clusters of fundamental psychological responses we do now -- fears, gratification, desires, strivings, frustrations, sadness, loneliness, exaltation, attraction, love, hate.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Organizations are likewise communities of individuals.  And no matter the rules of conduct -- the policies and guidelines of culture, conduct, ethics, and performance --  governing institutional life, the complexities and nuances of human psychology dominate and prevail.</p>
<p>As you ponder the exciting possibilities of designing better and more sophisticated cyber mousetraps, I urge you to always also remain curious about and keep focus on the mouse (or its human equivalent).<br /></p>","2016-02-15 19:20:43",342,5188,C,3042,D,"Let Me Tickle Your Brain !",2247,NULL,51

A more effective counter measure would be to work on developing a work environment that does not lead to insider threats. Through proper training or education, but also by making a worker policy that does not create resentment or lead to fear or mistakes when working. But precautions taken by the employer or company such as implementing passwords and multi-factor authentication across all systems, or only giving access to those that need it, and defending against certain code would be more effective.&nbsp;</p>","2016-02-15 21:18:21",342,5189,C,3042,D,"Let Me Tickle Your Brain !",2394,NULL,53

The Insider Threat already has possible access to what he/she is looking for.

Many of the readings talk about performing periodical checks and monitoring only certain aspects of an employee's usage, such as checking emails for certain keywords like customer information. Another example would be disabling the use of certain websites that may cause malware within the office computers. <br /></p>
<p>I also think that privacy begins to diminish when employees use company property for personal matters. Within my personal work experience I've been advised not to send, type, or look at anything that I wouldn't want the company executives to be aware of. Employers have the right to know what occurs during every employee's workday, not because they are suspicious of the employees but because, like many of the articles suggest, it is often an accidental incident that provides the gateway to an attack. It may just be the click on one wrong email that may cost the company thousands of dollars to fix damage that could have otherwise been prevented.&nbsp; <br /></p>
<p>However, I believe that what employees do on their personal time should not be monitored. Although, companies would only be monitoring for their interests only, there would be other people, like Snowden, who would feel that there are secrets and/or information that the world should be aware of.

So why can't a company block certain access to things through their wifi and their computers. One of my main points is a company e-mail is for company use so if someone is misusing the e-mail then it should be monitored and approached. Also, from the reading was a lack of security with technological and social advancements so why not start small and create fire walls, even though someone could program the computer to still receive access, it would be a small step. If it was in the case of fire walls being taken down the the company computers would be able to track this activity and find out who is the culprit. When it comes to personal cellphones or laptops that would not be acceptable, unless they are using the company wifi. If they are using the company wifi they are using part of the company and companies would have full permission to pursue any suspicious activity.

This way the employee in question cannot feel that their privacy is being taken away from them.

Your actions are what define you as an employee and i'm not saying put a tracker on every phone or track every single instant of someone's work day but if you establish in the beginning that every computer is monitored it would cause deterrence. Not everyone agrees on this because privacy is always a debate but I don't think having your WORK computer monitored would truly take away any privacy. People use these WORK computers to hack into the databases and destroy companies assets and relationships so why not pay attention to what the employees are doing and find the issue firsthand instead of realizing in the long run that you are bankrupt from someone using a computer right next to you or simply in your office.

I think that going around and spying on employees outside of the workplace is just unnecessary and completely unfair to them. I don't think there's any need for it. Besides it'll take more work to spy on employees outside of work AND have to maintain the security inside of the workplace also. They're pretty much putting more work on themselves by doing that; if you focus on just keeping the safety of the company then there's more focus on it, but by trying to spy on every single employee outside of their work hours AND during work then you'll need more man power and it's just too much work. A business is responsible for what happens inside of the workplace and the screening process should be able to pick out any red flags in someones previous employment also. Obviously there's no way to see if physically someone is a threat but if someone has a history of insider threat a company's screening should be able to at least some type red flags.&nbsp;</p>","2016-02-16 20:32:16",342,5227,C,3055,D,"Security Vs Privacy is it a Paradox or an Oxymoron ?",2342,NULL,53

5254,0,CC,"<p>I do feel as if the monitoring of employee activity outside of work is not necessarily the best way to maintain this &quot;employee privacy&quot; that everyone is speaking of. Yet, there has been many of times that employers look through a potential employees social media such as Facebook and Twitter to see if he or she is acting appropriately because in the end they will in the future represent the company as a whole. I have stated before that monitoring their behavior at work is completely acceptable. These employees are in the building, using the company's wifi server, using the company's computer software and ultimately working with the company's clients all day. These need to be regulated even simply by checking how an employee is talking to the client through e-mail. I am not totally for wiretapping a phone until the employee is a suspected of a crime and law enforcement is involved. A company does not hold the power of the legal system, but tracking e-mails, keeping track of firewalls taken down or even simply seeing who is accessing files that they should not is a company's right. They should know what each employee is doing and this invades no privacy what so ever. If a system was to be implemented this should be announced pre-employment and the new employee with be fully trained to have an understanding of this program and the seriousness that the company takes with insider threats.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>On the external level I believe it should be glimpses of social media if the persons name is linked to or associated with the company. Someone should not be leaving work and vulgarly complaining about the institution or in some context embarrassing the company. I am not saying that every employee should have to tell the employer the links to their social media, but everyone has a right to access Facebook, Twitter or such other feeds and if an employer checks it they do. I truly don't believe that is an invasion of privacy. An invasion of privacy would be logging into the account and looking through their e-mails or tracking their cell phone calls. The external tracking is something more I would associate with once an employee is accused of a crime and the legal system is involved because at that time the legal system has the right to &quot;Invade&quot; people's private things such as a phone or other systems under the Patriot Act. Before the legal system if an employer wants to &quot;track&quot; someone on their social media websites it should be stated in the pre-employment process such as &quot;Are you comfortable with us viewing your social media&quot; or such questions as that. A lot of companies do ask for links to social media and I don't find this wrong I find this appropriate because companies are trying to keep an image.&nbsp;</p>","2016-02-16 21:20:56",342,5231,C,3055,D,"Security Vs Privacy is it a Paradox or an Oxymoron ?",2339,NULL,53
5256,0,CC,"<p>To answer the CISO question, If I was in that position and we constantly were spending billions to pay for fines it doesn't make any sense to respect the right of privacy for those workers. It should be known that the monitoring is going happen not when but that it is going to happen internally and externally. Working for a company you must comply with them. If you believe this is against your privacy 1. your probably doing something wrong or you just need to find a new job.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>So to answer the question I would immediately notify employees of the monitoring, and begin random monitoring tests weekly to find any sort of threats and calculate the new risk factor.&nbsp;</p>","2016-02-16 22:15:32",342,5233,C,3055,D,"Security Vs Privacy is it a Paradox or an Oxymoron ?",2367,NULL,53
5257,0,CC,"<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;When responding to this question, I cannot help but think of the issue in terms of an economic standpoint. The employees are hired as human capital, or labor, to produce specified outputs for a company. Just as a machine completing other tasks requiring only artificial intelligence are open to being watched, monitored, etc., jobs requiring human labor are subject to the same monitoring. I think that the company should not even have to notify workers of the changes in monitoring, but that brings up a problematic legal question: Do those who fall under the category of &quot;human capital&quot; have human rights security-wise? To avoid this the company could easily have a portion of the employment contract dedicated to explaining their monitoring system and notify current staff members. I think during the span of the work day (I'll use a traditional 40 hour work week for this), the company has the right, or almost obligation as otherwise they would be losing money due to internal causes, to monitor all works of an individual. If this were some type of artificial intelligence we were speaking of, it would seem silly to allow it to cause billions of dollars in losses. And while I recognize that there are differences in rights of machines and humans (in regard to rights against discrimination, fair wages, rights against a physically or mentally abusive workplace, etc.), I don't think security falls under this category. Employees, or human capital, have the right to feel safe at work, not cost the company billions of dollars.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In regard to external life outside of the company, I think the general answer is to not look through an individual's private information. Going back to the idea of human capital, the individual is selling 40 hours of their time each week to the company, not their entire life. There are some exceptions to this, however. I believe that property given to the individual by the company (work phones, computers, or other devices) can be looked through. I view information on these as extensions of the company with the rights to be confiscated and monitored. Also, I believe that there should be key words that the company can search and access if the posts are public. If the individual is writing things using company names or information from their workplace, he/she is voluntarily choosing to use their free time to associate themselves with a company. By doing so, they are representing the company (free of cost) and the company should reserve the right to monitor this.The company can have this right and still preserve the privacy of the individual by searching terms and phrases associated with the workplace and sensitive information that the company is working with. If posts publicly&nbsp;appear, the individuals posting them should be held responsible for their words.<br /></p>","2016-02-16 23:46:58",342,5234,C,3055,D,"Security Vs Privacy is it a Paradox or an Oxymoron ?",2400,NULL,53

The first thing that came to my mind with this question was, &ldquo;Why wasn&rsquo;t there already such a program in place?&rdquo; Internal monitoring of behavior can range from something as basic as blocking certain social media websites to periodically acquiring and analyzing the contents of company computers. I have worked in environments where there was a mental health professional on call or in the office itself. This professional was made available so that employees could release stress stemming from the job and any related personal issues. Having such an individual in the building can be beneficial to both the employees, by providing services, and the company by providing valuable insight into potential risks and safety concerns.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>As you specially addressed concerns of the outright spying on employees, I am also mostly in favor of implementing an external program as well. Such a program could be as simple as creating a rules that, if broken,could end in employee termination. The rules could be centered on ensuring the employees are law-abiding citizens with few risk factors. I would utilize the requirements of security clearances as a framework. It would not be as strict or extensive, however. A lot can be achieved by emphasizing honesty. In other words, encouraging employees to be honest about behaviors that, if hidden,could be considered problematic. For example, alcoholism or a history of drug use are considered risk factors. If an employee is dishonest and hides such issues, the risk is magnified. However, if employees are encouraged to come forward with such issues, the company can foster positive relationships with its employees by allowing them to seek help rather than face immediate termination.This not only allows the company to monitor employee behavior, but it encourages a culture of transparency and integrity.</span></p>","2016-02-17 05:27:07",342,5242,C,3055,D,"Security Vs Privacy is it a Paradox or an Oxymoron ?",2404,NULL,53

<p>Another active ingredient in the mix, is trust. &nbsp;Some will say it's earned; others will claim it's built; yet others will point to how it's demonstrated through behavior not words. &nbsp;It is all of those and more. &nbsp;In organizations (as in relationships) trust can't just be militantly regulated or, conversely, merely allowed to cohere by itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;To devise and construct truly workable risk management, cyber security and anti-white collar crime programs, we will need to understand much more about what trust is, how it can be established, bolstered, and degraded. &nbsp;Trust -- and its counterpart (not its opposite) mistrust -- are vastly dense psychological and psychosocial concepts. &nbsp;What are your thoughts? &nbsp;</p>

5268,0,CC,"<p>I understand the morality of thinking about trust because if you are an employee you can should be &quot;trusted&quot; but I don't believe a social aspect of a relationship should keep a company from tracking what an employee is doing on their own network and work computers. A lot of companies have access to this already because it is their network that they pay for and allow one to use. If someone wants to have this sense of &quot;privacy&quot; then they need to establish their own network system that the company does not have to pay for. I also feel as if someone that is willing to pay for their own network because they don't want to be tracked will easily show that they are up to something that they shouldn't be while at the work place.</p>
<p>I could be a &nbsp;CEO of a company I could have a relationship amongst my colleagues that they &quot;trust&quot; me because I'm the head guy, I run everything. What happens though in this case?</p>
<p><span>http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ex-ceo-sentenced-to-50-years-for-stealing-215m/</span></p>
<p>This is just one of the many examples of people who are &quot;trusted&quot; and how it completely backfired. As a CEO of a company this building of trust obviously existed and this gained him some freedom within the company to access things that no one else could and look what happened. Within the article it shows even more stories about fraud that could have easily been detected if there was less &quot;trust&quot; and more monitoring. Now I feel like there should be a sense of trust and communication between a company but I define it as the terms &quot;i trust you to do your work&quot; &quot;i trust you to represent the company to its full potential&quot; not &quot;i trust you to not break into our important documents and steal all of the money&quot; because even the person who is not suspected of being able to do this can do this. To make my point clear I believe if you are at work everyone's web activity should be tracked within a system and red flags will go up on this system whenever something doesn't seem right. This system will not be bias to beginner jobs or the CEO. The company will explain pre-employment what will be going on while they are at work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Truly, a companies existence and reputation and especially funds are far more important than people feeling uncomfortable because their work computer is being monitored.&nbsp;</p>

5272,0,CC,"<p>Alyssa: I really like your input on this.  You're correctly introducing a critical element in every business, organization and corporation: the connection between trust and leadership.  To what extent is trust (or something approximating it) conferred or invested merely by the power of position Or title?  Or because somebody is seated in a position of trust or which entails being (or posturing) as trustworthy.  The relationship between power (or authority) and influence is central to coercion, manipulation, intimidation, and other related interactional forces in the bad actor's tool kit.</p>
<p>The Wasendorf/Peregrine Financial story first broke about 4 or so years ago.  Like Madoff, Ken Lay, Stanford, and others of that ilk, he was a deeply admired pillar of his community.  Google it and you'll find a bunch of super interesting articles in the NYT and elsewhere that discuss more details of what happened, including the devastation brought upon the victims (let us never lose sight of the victims!).</p>
<p>At every turn, Wasendorf's story is equally about everything underneath the mechanics of the fraudulent acts, deficiencies in regulatory oversight, and consequent economic damage inflicted on PFG's clients and public trust.  Like fraud itself, there is a shadow story.  It centers on the people: the massively complex ingredients driving the fraudster's actions (not merely the ostensible motive), the dynamics of concealment and deception, nesting chains of responses and decision-making by all involved parties, and more. Wasendorf's own self-diagnosing answer to the central dramatic question--why?--is only a pathetic rationale, and at best a point of entry, not a conclusion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These soft elements in fraud cases, together with the perp's guilty despair (or, with someone like Stanford, indignant denial), victims' anguish, and regulators' hand-wringing, add depth and dimension to the human interest angle which the press eats for breakfast.  But in the context of what I call &quot;warfare of the mind&quot; they also are uniquely valuable, actionable pieces of data for risk and security specialists. &nbsp; Regulators, auditors, bankers, investors, customers, watchdog agencies will continue to miss important signs of fraud because they focus on the donut, not the hole.  It is a serially fatal mistake: fraud by definition is executed through sophisticated sleight, feint, distraction, and manipulation.  Evidence will not be found by conventional audits scouring for expectable deviations or irregularities.<br /></p>","2016-02-17 17:31:41",342,5249,C,3055,D,"Security Vs Privacy is it a Paradox or an Oxymoron ?",2247,NULL,51

5296,0,CC,"<p>Gopal, that is a great question. I believe that it is very dependent on which type of market you are in. If you are in a financial market, you should have state-of-the-art security monitoring your company. If you are running a smaller business that doesn't have such sensitive data, maybe you shouldn't monitor your company as in-depth. I would recommend finding a balance between too much privacy and not enough privacy. With that, you might have automatic computer programs that filter out corruption within an organization and negligence to alert cyber-security personnel with notifications for further review.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I would not mind being spy on as long as it is in the company's property and their equipment. And they should make it easier on their selves by blocking social media websites and other websites that shouldn't be accessed in the first place. Why bother with spying on your employees by seeing what they do on Facebook or any other social media as long as your company can be more secure by blocking such activities in the first place.</p>
<p>The best way to avoid issues online is to block things from happening in the first place. If your employee only needs certain programs; they should only have those programs installed with only the limited rights that they need to do their job right and nothing more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a picture in my head of a company that does that and also have a few computers in the staff's lounge or lunch room for personal matters or social media when they are on their breaks. That way you can easily also keep those computers outside of the network that operates critical information.</p>","2016-02-18 03:00:32",342,5281,C,3055,D,"Security Vs Privacy is it a Paradox or an Oxymoron ?",2358,NULL,53

5308,0,CC,"<p style="""">Spy on me, but do not waste your time and money on a team of people to track my actions around the clock; Simply the knowledge that my actions as an employee were being intensely scrutinized for any signs of deception would be enough to discourage a sensible individual from trying to pull a fast, or slow one. Nonetheless, companies should take extensive care with safeguarding their data, and a good system for preventing data from being compromised which comes to mind, in addition to frequently auditing user accounts, is to not let any inside computers out or any outside computers in. If employees cannot bring computers in or out of a company building, &nbsp;and the appropriate security measures are taken to ensure not so much as a thumb drive sneaks in, it would greatly reduce the potential that a database could be compromised due to outside malware brought in by an ignorant employee. Of course companies should monitor the emails and network activity of their employees while at work, but should also include in an NDA that the digital sharing of work with computers outside of a companies network be prohibited. If employees are all made aware of this, and open ports are kept to a minimum with a rotating team of IT security officers watching around the clock, an insider threat would be incredibly easy to track down.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="""">Granted, with sensitive enough information being handled, one may want to keep tabs on their employees outside of office hours, and for good reason. In this case, I would recommend companies assess a multitude of plausible worst-case scenarios from whistleblowers. I would want to keep tabs on my employees at varying levels depending on their level of access to sensitive information, spending more resources on higher-access employees than on lesser-access employees.</p>
<p style="""">I would argue that a balanced approach to employee monitoring such as mine would be beneficial to a large company and would not be too expensive to implement either.&nbsp;</p>","2016-02-18 06:50:10",342,5289,C,3055,D,"Security Vs Privacy is it a Paradox or an Oxymoron ?",2361,NULL,53

<p>Raven,&nbsp;<br /><br />Yes, no, and maybe. &nbsp;It really depends on the situation.<br /><br />If you read the recent news, you'll see executives from financial institutions indicted or going to jail; it's often not a Chief Compliance Officer (CCO). &nbsp;It's usually an executive (outside of the compliance function) who violated statutory requirements and most likely several regulations and company policies as well. &nbsp;<br /><br />If a CCO is indicted or goes to jail, it's usually because they were knowingly breaking the law, regulation, or company policy; I'll include some examples below. &nbsp;Outside of jail time, CCOs are held accountable by the Board and regulators. &nbsp;Ultimately, if they are negligent in their duties as a CCO, at a minimum, they will lose their job. &nbsp;If their actions are grossly negligent, then you start to move towards more serious penalties, fines, etc. &nbsp;I am not a lawyer and this is definitely not my area of expertise.<br /><br />I also do not have an extensive history in the financial industry, so I can talk mostly about the last 3-5 years and what I've seen from a legal/regulatory perspective. &nbsp;<br /><br /><b>Here are some quick executive (not CCO) examples from the last year</b>:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-bank-america-executive-sentenced-serve-26-months-prison-role-conspiracy-and-fraud"">http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-bank-america-executive-sentenced-serve-26-months-prison-role-conspiracy-and-fraud</a><br /></p>

<p>Great articles, especially the one concerning ongoing controversy over the Apple vs. FBI case. I think it has a lot to do with ethics in cyber security, and I believe that Apple is doing the right thing for standing up for privacy, even though the intentions of FBI are good. Here's another article related to this case that I found interesting:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.wired.com/2016/02/apples-fbi-battle-is-complicated-heres-whats-really-going-on/?mbid=nl_21816"">http://www.wired.com/2016/02/apples-fbi-battle-is-complicated-heres-whats-really-going-on/?mbid=nl_21816</a>&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Regarding this week's topic of insider threat, I think that it is important to realize that not all insiders have malicious intent and that so called negligent or accidental insiders can be just as dangerous. In my opinion, however, negligent/accidental insiders can be prevented if the organization is putting serious effort into staff training and has a set of security policies that are strictly enforced and constantly updated. Here's a good article about accidental insiders: <a href=""http://searchcompliance.techtarget.com/feature/Negligence-accidents-put-insider-threat-protection-at-risk"">http://searchcompliance.techtarget.com/feature/Negligence-accidents-put-insider-threat-protection-at-risk</a>&nbsp;</p>","2016-02-19 09:12:18",341,5332,C,3086,D,"Interesting News in Cyberworld",2387,NULL,53

The problem now is that because the evolution of technology, every electronic device is how being integrated with wireless connection. So now spy agencies have now a back door or found a loop hole in the freedom act because it doesn't really cover the aspects of bugging a toaster to start eavesdropping on the person that they are following, also it gives hackers other ways to get into a system because the electronic might not have good security measures or lack of security. At the end of the article it spoke about how congress should increase there use of encryption, i remember one of my professors speaking about quantum computing and how that would change the ball game because now AES encryption or any other encryption can be cracked in the way of minutes, or hours. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>","2016-02-19 15:47:39",341,5333,C,3086,D,"Interesting News in Cyberworld",2390,NULL,53

<p><span>Companies have the right to take action to protect their domains, assets property etc. against the insider threat. They must be able to protect their employees, assets and property in order for the company to succeed.

<p><span>In general, it is safe to assume that you have more privacy in your own home than at work, school etc. For example, usually students inmiddle school and high school have lockers.

Therefore, when there are locker searches, as long as the school follows legal protocol, it is permitted. It is the same general idea except it is being applied to the work environment. </span></p>
<p><span>Atthe same time, if companies overreach and monitor every action of every employee, the data becomes useless. Companies would be overusing resources thatcould be put to better use. Therefore, I would propose a balanced approach. This approach would include an assessment to target what the company has done to mitigate threats and vulnerabilities in the past. It would also analyze where the most important assets of the business and what is worth the extra protection. </span></p>","2016-02-21 01:47:08",342,5349,C,3055,D,"Security Vs Privacy is it a Paradox or an Oxymoron ?",2341,NULL,53

<p>Thank you very much for sharing!</p>

<p>I have a question. It seems that recently <b>malicious</b> use of encryption is brought to light a lot. It includes the supposed use of encrypted communications by terrorists, e.g. the Apple story, and increasing number of ransomware hostages (another case of victim paying for decryption in school of South Carolina --&gt;&nbsp;<a href=""http://news.softpedia.com/news/us-school-agrees-to-pay-8-500-to-get-rid-of-ransomware-500684.shtml"">http://news.softpedia.com/news/us-school-agrees-to-pay-8-500-to-get-rid-of-ransomware-500684.shtml</a>). &nbsp;With mass media building the narrative to point out that encryption is clearly dangerous, if, theoretically, the government decided to restrict the use of encryption, then how would it implement such decision?&nbsp;</p>","2016-02-21 03:19:11",341,5350,C,3086,D,"Interesting News in Cyberworld",2385,NULL,53

<p><br /></p>

<p>Hello Robert, I have a quick question for you that may seem a bit off-topic, does the FISA Court have any actual power? Whether it be enforcement power of it's rulings or any political power in general. The reason why I ask this&nbsp;<span>the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ruled on October 3, 2011 that the NSA metadata collection violated the Fourth Amendment and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978.</span><span>&nbsp;Yet it seems the NSA is still collecting metadata. See article&nbsp;<a href=""http://ez.lib.jjay.cuny.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=i3h&amp;AN=95567183&amp;site=ehost-live"">http://ez.lib.jjay.cuny.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=i3h&amp;AN=95567183&amp;site=ehost-live</a>&nbsp;(page 117).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><br /></span></p>

<p><span>I don't believe that encryption is dangerous, but I do believe having &quot;backdoors&quot; is more dangerous because it leaves us more vulnerable to outside attacks. If anything, having stronger encryption is better for the everyday law abiding citizen because we value our privacy. See articles&nbsp;<a
      href=""http://bgr.com/2016/01/13/ex-nsa-chief-hayden-encryption/"">http://bgr.com/2016/01/13/ex-nsa-chief-hayden-encryption/</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2015/12/15/how-the-nsa-tried-to-build-safe-encryption-but-failed/"">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2015/12/15/how-the-nsa-tried-to-build-safe-encryption-but-failed/</a>. I know you asked for the teams opinion on the matter, so I'm stating that these comments are not the views of Team 1 Cyber S.E.A.L.S. and instead are the views of myself.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>One con to encryption is that on the off chance a tragedy occurs, such as a terrorist attack, law enforcement may have a difficult time in responding to the incident. But even then, not all terrorist attacks are coordinated with encrypted systems, see&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20151118/08474732854/after-endless-demonization-encryption-police-find-paris-attackers-coordinated-via-unencrypted-sms.shtml"">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20151118/08474732854/after-endless-demonization-encryption-police-find-paris-attackers-coordinated-via-unencrypted-sms.shtml</a>.</span></p>
<p><span><br /></span></p>
<p><span>I believe that the government should have the ability to decrypt because for physical evidence, there are ways for the government to obtain it, so it is only fair for the government to be able to obtain digital evidence locked behind encryption. That being said, I don't believe having backdoors in encryption is the way to go. I acknowledge that this may seem contradictory, however I also don't know of an alternative that the government could possibly use right now.&nbsp;</span></p>","2016-02-21 19:58:25",341,5354,C,3086,D,"Interesting News in Cyberworld",2382,NULL,53
5367,0,CC,"<p>In my opinion, I think that it is important for companies to monitor what employees are doing. It would be extremely difficult to detect insider threat if they aren't being monitored. Any actions that are being performed on the company's servers or on the phone should be subject to going through compliance. If there is nothing to hide I do not think it should be problematic. As far as outside of the office I think that employees should be required to use technology that is provided by the company and have to be used in order to access company files or anything of that sort. In one of the readings it states that one of the most common threats is opportunity. If employees know that they are not being monitored then there is opportunity for them to attempt to engage in some kind of espionage, potentially without being detected by the company.&nbsp;<span>That being said I think there should be some sort of limit on what personal information the business should have access to. There is a thin line between what information is helpful to the company and what is intrusive which is why finding a balance is troublesome and may need to be looked at on a case by case basis.</span></p>

<p>Andrew, &quot;power&quot; is a relative term. &nbsp;<br /><br />Some good (first party) resources on FISA so you understand the court's mandate:<br /><a

5401,0,CD,"<p><span style="""">I would like to ask about hierarchical location of the behavior analyst position within the industry. While many if not all the readings stress the importance of the interpersonal aspect of cyber security, they also alluded to lack of focus that the industry places on it. Are behavioral analysts within the industry seen as subsequently unimportant and therefore placed in lower positions relative to technical positions?&nbsp;</span></p>","2016-02-24 01:52:41",341,3103,D,NULL,NULL,"Organizational positions of Behavior Analysts",2417,"2016-02-24 01:52:41",53

<p>I would say that the characteristic that makes an insiderthreat malicious is deception. Once trusted within an organization, a maliciousinsider can deceive those around him/her with ease. Organizations fail to studythe motives behind an individual&rsquo;s actions closely and this is what allowsthings to go unseen until it&rsquo;s too late. The characteristic that makes aninsider threat non-malicious is ignorance. When sensitive information is lostor leaked accidentally it is because the insider does not understand how toproperly protect them. This can be said for those that work within and outsideof the workplace. It is the job of anyone within the organization to make surethat they are aware of the proper practices and policies needed to protect and maintaincompany assets. </p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>The most common method of operation for an insider wouldhave to be the exploitation of remote access software. Insiders are less likelyto be caught stealing sensitive information if there is an established way toaccess it offsite. Offsite access to a company&rsquo;s computer system is the easiestmethod of entry for any potential insider threat.</p>
<p>3.</p>
<p>The ideal Insider Threat program would need to incorporate strictmonitoring of all employee activities involving the manipulation of sensitiveinformation whether it is on or offsite. The program should focus on helpingemployees understand the policies and practices crucial to protectingorganizational assets. This means also making sure that employees themselvesare vigilantly looking out for suspicious activity along with complementarytechnical monitoring. <span>&nbsp;</span>The goal is todetect and respond to the threat before it can do any damage by analyzing anytype of symptoms displayed physically, verbally, or online.</p>","2016-02-24 03:03:52",342,5394,C,3099,D,"Characteristics of An Insider (Threat Actor)  - Need Response",2409,NULL,53

<p>Some things to think about as the teams start building out their insider threat programs.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.federaltimes.com/story/government/dhs/blog/2016/02/15/building-insider-threat-program/80421442/"">http://www.federaltimes.com/story/government/dhs/blog/2016/02/15/building-insider-threat-program/80421442/</a><br /><br /></p>
<p style=""""><strong>1: Know your data.</strong></p>
<p style="""">You can&rsquo;t protect something you don&rsquo;t know anything about. It&rsquo;s vitally important to catalog the information your systems contain. Answering questions like &ldquo;What server is that data on?&rdquo; &ldquo;Where is that information physically located?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Who has access to that application?&rdquo; is a much more important step than many organizations realize.</p>
<p style="""">A formal data map and access audit are the foundations for a successful insider threat program.</p>
<p style=""""><strong>2: Set priorities.</strong></p>
<p style="""">I worked with an organization that was in the process of mapping its data for many reasons, one of which was creating an insider threat program. One of the first days on site with them, I asked &ldquo;Have you identified your crown jewels?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="""">They proudly answered &ldquo;Yes, all 80-plus of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="""">I give them credit for trying to prioritize their data, but more than 80 crown jewels? Really? That&rsquo;s simply too many priorities to work with. Instead, we recommended that they try to create priorities within those applications by considering which applications or data would cripple the organization if they were compromised and place those specific items at the top. These priorities are what we consider to be their critical value data<em>.</em></p>
<p style="""">While massive databases of customer data are very important, sometimes very specific documents like strategic plans or company financials would prove more damaging if they fell into the wrong hands. These are also easier to identify and protect than huge sets of data, which can come later on in the process.</p>
<p style=""""><strong>3: It&rsquo;s not just about technology.</strong></p>
<p style="""">Insider threats are not merely a technology problem. They&rsquo;re also a risk management problem, as we wrote in our whitepaper, &quot;A Holistic Approach to Countering Insider Threats.&quot; An organization needs to set this expectation early and bring it up often during the building and implementation process. You may need to elevate insider threats out of the IT department; to give it the proper attention, it needs to make its way to the C-suite and the boardroom.</p>
<p style="""">Many &ldquo;programs&rdquo; are technical implementations, tools that sound good when they are pitched or demonstrated but that fall short when they are installed and start getting used in a real environment. They either don&rsquo;t do everything that they claim to do or, more often, they fall short because the right training, procedures, awareness&nbsp;and other supporting factors aren&rsquo;t put into place.</p>
<p style="""">Building an insider threat program takes all of these things to succeed. Of course technology is important. But tools are only one piece of the puzzle. By setting expectations with the organization&rsquo;s leadership (not just IT leadership, but all leadership), targeting the most critical value data, and focusing equal attention on the factors surrounding the technology, you can set yourself on the path to creating an effective, functional, and complete insider threat program.</p>","2016-02-24 04:25:44",341,3104,D,NULL,NULL,"Where do you start when building an insider threat program?",2249,"2016-03-01 20:59:52",51

<p>I thought these were some useful articles to share, but besides that I think its interesting to see a split in opinion between differing tech companies such as Facebook and Microsoft.

FBI Director Jay Comey stated &quot;<span style="""">We simply want the chance, with a search warrant, to try to guess the terrorist's passcode without the phone essentially self-destructing and without it taking a decade to guess correctly&quot;.

With the growing problem of insider/outsider attacks, it is crucial that any program in place is actually implemented to be able to prevent, detect, and respond to attacks. Being that insider threat can be hard to detect with the use of technology, most companies rely on the &quot;see something, say something&quot; policy. &nbsp;The problem with this is that most people are worried about gaining a stigma of being a &quot;rat&quot; or a &quot;snitch&quot; that they tend to just keep whatever information they do have to themselves. &nbsp;This is why it is important that an insider threat program has an anonymous reporting system. &nbsp;This would allow people to report any suspicious activities, while keeping their identity private. &nbsp;I feel that would be a much more effective program.

<p>Great article about the implementation of tools and also how good leadership is very important. I have personally witnessed management in a company be so corrupt that it spills over on to the rest of the employees. There were policies and procedures that one had to follow but as some may know management never followed those rules. Also, leaving employees to their own accounts and doing as they please. Moreover, employees also working with other people in management defrauding the organization of its funds. Not all monitoring systems can be effective unless the person in charge is following the rules that are implemented. Of course, outside auditing and other forms of third party investigators should come in and make their observations in order to make their decisions unbiasedly.</p>","2016-02-24 20:30:04",341,5403,C,3104,D,"Where do you start when building an insider threat program?",2383,NULL,53

5435,0,CC,"<p>1. For a malicious insider threat I would characterize them as spiteful. After becoming trusted with information, say one thing went wrong and the person took it the wrong way used his spite to try to steal that information from the firm. For a non-malicious threat I would say they are naive. They overlook one silly mistake they made and open up a world of problems for the company</p>
<p>2. I would agree with James with that it is usually done at an offsite location</p>
<p>3. basically the plan of any plan is to educate the employees to be able to not make stupid mistakes which will help the non-malicious insiders stop. But for the malicious we will do our best with the past work on the last insider and use steps taken from the last one and teach our employees and especially the insider threat planning team to read these threats by noticing when someone is downloading a database knowing when those things occur will help stop these people from bring them to an off site because if you see an employee downloading something he shouldnt be downloading you can stop him</p>","2016-02-25 22:02:26",342,5422,C,3099,D,"Characteristics of An Insider (Threat Actor)  - Need Response",2367,NULL,53
5439,0,CC,"<p>1. I would describe the human characteristic of an insider threat would be awkwardness, which has many different meaning. In this case, I mean the sense of awkwardness where you make everyone else uncomfortable around you, whether this is intentional or unintentional. In a malicious stand point, it's the kind of awkwardness where it's intentional, they try to make others feel uncomfortable so much that they start to question their owns actions, versus the person that's making them feel inferior. Going along with what James and Max said, spitefulness and deceptiveness usually cause someone to act awkward and make others around them uncomfortable, usually due to their hidden agenda. On the flip side, someone who awkward by making people feel uncomfortable unintentionally would be someone who is non-malicious. The reason being for that is because they are most likely a nervous individual, that their nervous anxiety compromises their performance, causing risk for a unintentional error.</p>
<p>2. I also agree with James, it would be performed outside of the location, due to the security that's within one's place of work. It also gives them an opportunity to frame (maliciously) someone else in order to keep themselves off the radar.</p>
<p>3. From a psychological standpoint, I like using the cognitive test of implicit attitudes for the malicious insider threats. This approach makes them respond to a stimulus in the quickest way possible, leaving no room for possible alternative thoughts (<b>lying</b>). How the experiment works is complex, but I will discuss it in our next meeting this Friday. As far as non-malicious insider threats, extensive training on how to do the work you are presented with, and cognitive behavioral therapy on how you deal with that work if it ever puts you in an uncomfortable position. That way, people <b>KNOW</b> what they're doing, and can <b>HANDLE</b> the hardships that may entail in cybersecurity.</p>","2016-02-26 04:36:01",342,5427,C,3099,D,"Characteristics of An Insider (Threat Actor)  - Need Response",2393,NULL,53

<p>2. I also agree with what James says but also an insider threat that is an IT work or system admin may attack directly inside the company because they have direct access to the system and all the files.</p>
<p>3. The main part of our program would be monitoring. Increased monitoring of employees would help us see who is doing what.

Maybe they never intended to commit any fraud, and I am sure most employees have good intentions, but something later on pushes them to the 'other side'. In this case, I don't think that any screenings would be able to detect future crime, this sounds kind of like the plot of 'Minority Report', and unfortunately(or fortunately) we don't have that type of technology yet. Therefore, since we can't predict how a person will behave several years into their employment, the best way to prevent is to implement various security controls to make it virtually impossible for one to commit any type of insider fraud. Strict enforcement of these controls is also crucial for positive outcome.&nbsp;<span>I believe that one's behavior is the key to prevention, so I would create some sort of behavioral screening or monitoring.&nbsp;</span></p>","2016-02-28 03:26:26",341,5470,C,3134,D,"Question(s) to the class",2387,NULL,53

<p>Thank you for thought-provoking questions!</p>
<p><span>1.</span></p>
<p><span>Malicious insiders are people, and people are a product of society. Western society these days is driven by consumerism culture, where one&rsquo;s &ldquo;perceived status&quot; is defined by how much one can afford to consume. People who buy-in to this culture will inevitably strive for more material wealth. Consequently, when one is presented with opportunity to get &ldquo;easy money&rdquo; via fraud, illegal selling of data or intellectual property, it&rsquo;s increasingly hard for the person to resist the malicious act because the ultimate goal is to improve one&rsquo;s status in consumerist society.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What about those few who do not buy in to such culture? They are going against the system and are also included in the risk group. If one detests the system, one would try sabotage the operations of an organization(part of the system) and in that case would be driven by ideological motivations.</span></p>
<p><span>In one way or another, the culture and current societal values push people towards malicious actions.</span></p>
<p><span>Another factor is that human relationships are never perfect, there are always some conflicts among people within the organization, which brings stress and discontent. Discontent triggers the urge for revenge, which can be expressed through a malicious action. Not much can be done to alter human relationships and human nature.</span></p>
<p><span>This brings me to the following conclusion:</span></p>
<p />
<p><span>2.</span></p>
<p><span>People are the sole cause of the problem, so in order to decrease the problem it&rsquo;s necessary to decrease the amount of people in an organization. Minimum people, maximum technology could significantly weaken the risk of insider threat. For example latest AI could completely replace outsourced&nbsp;call center workers, I&rsquo;m sure a lot of other positions can be replaced by custom software. Those few humans would be responsible for monitoring and maintaining the software, and if they are very well compensated, its would also reduce the risk of malicious actions. It would also be helpful to create a very comfortable atmosphere for those few humans working, so they would treat the organization like a second home, and not a chore; and would be genuinely interested in the organization&rsquo;s well being.</span></p>
<p><span>3.</span></p>
<p><span>Because maximum automation is a gradual process, the number of people working for organization cannot be reduced immediately. Thus, to mitigate insider threats at this point it&rsquo;s necessary to deal with people. In my opinion, awareness is not always the panacea. If it was, no one would eat in McDonalds. I think humans need human oversight. Such procedure as peer supervision could make a change. It would be implemented for workers with access to critical/valuable information and those with root privilege. It would work best if the peer is anonymous and different every day, to exclude the chance of collusion. When a worker will make an attempt to access the critical data, he will not be able to proceed without a peer entering his credentials and joining the worker&rsquo;s machine remotely to see exactly what the worker is doing. I&rsquo;m not sure what effect it might have on a person&rsquo;s mind, because it sounds a little Orwellian, but I believe it might work.</span></p>","2016-02-28 17:55:40",341,5473,C,3134,D,"Question(s) to the class",2385,NULL,53
5487,0,CC,"<p>1.To define an individual as a typical insider, I would define him/her as a an individual with access to confidential data of any sort. Some of the indicators of individuals who are malicious (from the earlier readings) include having foreign contacts, having repeated involvement in security violations, and having unexplainable affluence. During a portion of the readings entitled, &ldquo;Traditional Insider Threat meets Cyber,&rdquo; the writer looked at typical predispositions that are common among individuals that are malicious. These included serious mental illness, personality problems, social skills and decision-making deficits, and history of rule violation. Most individuals typically were not extremely social and tended to keep to themselves.</p>
<p>2.Typically, those committing insider crimes did not use a highly technical route to take information. A majority of fraud cases, for example, are committed by non-technical employees. Employees would use things such as flash drives, emailing themselves information, or using drop box to gain the information. This makes it clear that crimes are more likely to be committed by privileged accounts with access to the information. A majority of individuals don&rsquo;t collude to commit crimes, but if they do they typically use external sources to collude.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Most crimes were committed by privileged accounts, and most instances of fraud are caught by audits of the individual&rsquo;s computer, so I would extend these audits to any accounts that currently do not get them, and heavily monitor the privileged accounts in a company. A vast majority of insider crimes target customer information, so I would also implement extremely stringent controls on anyone who has the ability to access this.<br /></p>","2016-02-28 22:30:56",342,5474,C,3099,D,"Characteristics of An Insider (Threat Actor)  - Need Response",2400,NULL,53
5488,0,CC,"<p>Hello Robert,</p>
<p>I think the main issue with industry keeping up with insider threat attacks is that people are unpredictable. One of the papers last week showed that the insider threat is often a trusted employee. Although there are ways of mitigating the insider threat by placing access controls and restricting the privileges of users, this is not foul proof. I think the best way of mitigating the risk of an insider threat is to offer positive incentives for people to speak up if they are able to detect an employee who is going to sabotage the company. Positive incentives are potential bonuses for catching a disloyal employee. Technology cannot keep with the potential insider threats so there isa need for the human component of detecting the insider threat. The best line of defense in my opinion is a company&rsquo;s own employee who interacts daily with potential insider threats. <span>&nbsp;</span>The best control in my opinion is to not allow one-person access to all information. &nbsp;For example, let&rsquo;s say we are in an engineering company on a biomedical system.There is the coding aspect of the machine as well as the physical components of the machine. The people working on the physical access of the machine should not have access to the code and vice-versa unless there is a need for testing.This will help mitigate the risk of sensitive information being leaked as not one person has all the sensitive information. <span>&nbsp;</span></p>","2016-02-29 00:39:31",341,5475,C,3134,D,"Question(s) to the class",2384,NULL,53

<p style="""">Thank you for the good questions</p>
<p
    style="""">The biggest concern for industries is the loss of there customers private data, or the loss of&nbsp;sensitive data. The impact of insider to todays industries are really high due to the fact that its really impossible to detect an insider. The loses that the readings estimated is in the billions, and because the lack of enforcement of the policies allow insider to run a muck on the company that they are working. Another reason why they cant figure out the increase because nobody can tell if an employee is committing these &nbsp;acts or if someone is doing any malicious activity other employees aren't reporting it because they might not know where to go to report these actions or they just don't see any change in behavior. There are many ways that we can decrease insider threat, one way is have training programs for the employees telling them about insider threat and what they can do to prevent/fight against insider threat. They can also have strict monitoring on what the employee does on there station, and limit the connection on personal devices being connected to the company's wifi. Also they can record all network traffic and see which employee is doing on there system, and if there are doing anything that they aren't supposed to do, and check if any employee is accessing data that they aren't<span>&nbsp;</span>supposed to see. I would implement a strict monitoring system on employee stations, and company network traffic(&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.networkworld.com/article/2163156/security/ibm-security-tool-can-catch-insider-threats--fraud.html"">http://www.networkworld.com/article/2163156/security/ibm-security-tool-can-catch-insider-threats--fraud.html</a>), I would try like to achieve this because I had read an article about how IBM is using a security tool that will detect inside and outside threats, they started to try to implement this around 2011, so that why i would try to the same thing to fight insider threat. &nbsp;</p>","2016-02-29 01:33:06",341,5476,C,3134,D,"Question(s) to the class",2390,NULL,53
5490,0,CC,"<p><span style="""">Nikki I have enjoyed reading your answer, and will like to continue the discussion with the following points:</span></p>
<p><span style="""">1.Yes, fewer than 50% of organization implements appropriate prevention mechanisms against insider attacks.</span></p>
<p><span style="""">2.However, as the percentage of those attacks are relatively smaller then&quot;outside&quot; attacks, executives tend to priorities the latter.</span></p>
<p>3.Therefore, I must ask, does a world where humans replaced by computers will be a better solution? (From cyber-crime point of view) yes there's a rise in insider attacks, however we should remember that both software and hardware are human made, and those are usually written without any special care to security (and&nbsp;unfortunately&nbsp;are not safe from coding / implementation mistakes).</p>","2016-02-29 02:58:50",341,5477,C,3134,D,"Question(s) to the class",2416,NULL,53
5491,0,CC,"<p>1. I am aware that numerous statistics show that the insider threat is on increase, but does it mean that people are stealing and cheating more? In Hammurabi&rsquo;s Law code, the punishment for stealing was death. Stealing is stealing and nothing changed over the centuries, I think. Invention of writing is credited to Sumerians, but sometimes to Egyptians. Did someone steal the idea? Now we would call it theft of intellectual property. Is the insider threat really on increase or is it a combination of exaggerated mass media reporting and an effective marketing strategies to convince organizations to invest more in personnel and technology to combat the insider threat? I am aware that I am answering a question with more questions ;)</p>
<p>2. I know we&rsquo;ve been reminded that the insider threat is more cultural than a tech problem, but considering that the most valuable assets are in the digital form, only with technology one can decrease the frequency and impact of insider threat. Policies, procedures and education are important, but it can only be enforced with technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. There are many solutions and some good ones were already mentioned by my peers. The Hammurabi&rsquo;s Law code would be a strong deterrent for sure. Also, body worn video cameras that employees would wear to increase accountability. <br /></p>","2016-02-29 06:54:03",341,5478,C,3134,D,"Question(s) to the class",2380,NULL,53

5493,0,CC,"<p>1. Petr, I am not the Conspiracy Theory supporter, but in this case I absolutely agree with you. Mass Media and Marketing strategists are doing their job very well. But even if they are&nbsp;making&nbsp;mountains out of molehills, trying to bring more money to the relatively new industry of computer security, the problem of insider threat still exists. It is often easier and cheaper to pay the insider than organize efficient hacking attack. More we improve the security, more chances that insider threat gonna come into sight.</p>

<p>2. Nicki, the idea of &quot;peer supervision&quot; is great, but not every ''peer'' knows how to properly ''supervise&quot; -at&nbsp;<span style="""">least to do that insensibly.

5496,0,CC,"<p>1. Even if the mass media is making mountains out of mole hills what do they get out of it? Fear mongering? For what purpose does that serve? I don't know if insider threats are truly on the rise, because it isn't like companies release information regarding their insider threats per fiscal year or how much they lost due to an insider threat per fiscal year. As for the industry not being able to stem the frequency and impact, well as others here have said, industries aren't allocating enough resources to prevent and detect insider incidents.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>2. To expand on Nikki's and Dmitry's response in regard to changing the atmosphere for the work place to feel like a second home, companies can give monthly awards out to employees or yearly rewards. I know Chase bank gives 20 years, 25 years, 30 years, etc., of service awards to the respective employees. Some bosses also take their employees out to lunch every now and then which I'm sure builds a personal relationship between employer and employee. I know some business such as Burns &amp; McDonnell, an engineering and architecture firm, has specialized weeks that completely changes the work environment. One day during the week they would have a Chili Bowl, where employees can submit their own homemade chili for a competition, or desert another day. One week they'll have sort of like a 'mock' Olympics on the Nintendo Wii. While these activities may seem childish, or not appropriate for the work place, I'm willing to bet top dollar that this business has an immensely low insider threat frequency, if they have one at all.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>3. To mitigate the insider threat, I would keep the very important and sensitive data in physical form, such as papers in folder's in a filing cabinet that's under lock and key. Transfer the data from digital to physical and there would be no worry of worms, malicious programs, downloading onto USB drivers, or any other technological way. That's the majority of the battle already won, and just have x amount of trusted employees with high security clearance to protect the room that contains said filing cabinets.&nbsp;</p>","2016-03-01 01:50:49",341,5482,C,3134,D,"Question(s) to the class",2382,NULL,53

5500,0,CC,"<p>1. I like what Andrew said about companies not releasing information about the losses due to insider threats. It really helps express this point I had in my mind about this question, which is companies wouldn't want to release this information because it's bad for their public reputation. Since no statistics are given people don't really dive into this issue of insider threats because there isn't a lot of data on the damages done by an insider threat. That's why companies aren't willing allocate resources to prevent insider threats.</p>
<p>2. To decrease the frequency and impacts of insider threats, I would recommend limiting access to databases, and requiring employees to have their own passwords. Doing this would limit the amount of people who can have access to highly sensitive data that is used for insider threats. I do like the idea of forming a sense of community in the workplace but unfortunately people can still turn sides in a heartbeat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. I would create a screen share monitoring system. It's like a video camera but it records the desktop. It records every computer in the company so that any type of people that want to do harm to the company would think twice about it. Also develop an algorithm where it detects any anomalies done on the desktop, stuff the original user wouldn't do on the desktop. When the algorithm detects these anomalies actions can be taken to quickly identify what is going on.&nbsp;</p>","2016-03-01 03:03:33",341,5486,C,3134,D,"Question(s) to the class",2388,NULL,53
5501,0,CC,"<p>I believe that industry is unable to stem the increase of insider threats because it is difficult to determine who the threats really are. Insider threats are people and it is fairly difficult to determine who will become a threat before they act. Like Andrey said, one of the case studies pointed out that the average insider threat has been with the company for five years. Our society today is divided by the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; and the &ldquo;have-nots&rdquo;. Normal employees become insiders because they wish to elevate their status,&nbsp;thus becoming&nbsp;&ldquo;haves&rdquo;. </p>
<p><span style="""">Insider threat will never be eradicated because with every possible solution to the problem, two more vulnerabilities are exploited. Industry can attempt to decrease the frequency and impact of insider threat by implementing various deterrents. Industry can maintain proper access control, thus preventing access to trade secrets by those who are not on the need to know. Honeypots are also good ways for industry to bait and catch insider threats without putting trade secrets at risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="""">If I could create one control to mitigate the insider threat, I think I would create a system that would monitor each employee to develop a pattern of when information is accessed and where. This system would then be able to detect anomalies in the pattern and flag it as a possible breech of security.</span></p>","2016-03-01 14:47:40",341,5487,C,3134,D,"Question(s) to the class",2391,NULL,53

5505,0,CC,"<p style="""">1. I believe that there are many reasons why there has been an increase of cybersecurity threats and I do not think there is one main reason as to why there has been an increase. However, I do believe that there are some very important factors that may contribute to the increase of cybersecurity threats. One of the important factor is due to the fact that there are many opportunities lying around for employees with malicious intent to steal data - there simply isn't enough manpower to search through hundreds of employees that look suspicious and human behavior is unpredictable, as Andrey has pointed out earlier. Another important factor is &nbsp;due to the fact that some companies have cybersecurity teams but the cybersecurity teams are not doing their jobs in protecting their companies in due to negligence, and/or have not discovered the new ways that employees have found to bypass security measure (whether this may be due to carelessness of the employee or true malicious intent).&nbsp;</p>
<p style="""">2. To decrease the frequency and impact of insider threats, I believe that companies should have a stricter policy and reinforce the policy for breaking rules to deter employees from doing illegal things and making sure the incident prevention team is doing what they are suppose to do. Companies should also restrict the access of social media, USB drives and any other electronic devices that allows for capturing and recording of screens, and should anything happens, have all departments (like HR, IT, and security) communicate with each other to prevent the leakage of sensitive information.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="""">3. I would implement a personality/inventory test before hiring future employees - specifically a test that tests for openness, conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism, and extroversion. A personality test may help in understanding the traits of an employee and also help in pin-pointing specific employees that may have the need to be monitor if stressors (like financial issues, or behavioral issues) are apparent.&nbsp;</p>","2016-03-01 18:49:40",341,5491,C,3134,D,"Question(s) to the class",2378,NULL,53

5511,0,CC,"<p>1. There is not enough control over insiders I believe. Also, the ease of access to important information has made this problem even worst. Sometime problems are overlooked or not given the right amount of attention. In a world that technology is increasingly growing, many places find it hard to keep up with the movement of technology including new methods that are being used to threaten the financial institutions. I also believe in a place where there is money there is always a chance of having an insider threat problem. This has been happening since before computers came out and will continue for as long as theres a way to steal information or money. Hopefully organizations can manage to train and hire as many staff members who can at least stabilize and control the problem to a minimum.?</p>
<p>2. In order to decrease the frequency and impact of the insider threat there has to be a very strict program set in place. More funds have to go into the building systems that control employees, biometrics machines, and access control. One other thing I always thought was in the psychological sense, its always good to treat employees as best as possible. Employees are possibly if not a company&rsquo;s greatest asset. There should maybe be special incentives or greater benefits that are given to employees. Some incentive can include money or promotions for great work, benefits can include health insurance, gym memberships, or life insurance that can benefit that employees family. Also, making an employee feel a sense of belonging and satisfied can go a long way. ?</p>
<p>3. Besides computers and controls and everything that we could possibly implement I think that the best way to mitigate the insider threat is creating a program that is interactive with the employees. I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of the places that I&rsquo;ve worked in the past and noticed that working together with people and making them feel as if they are there for a reason has always worked in the employers favor. They have made money, no one stole anything, and probably protected it like if it was their own business. My plan would to make it a workplace that is more friendly orientated and make the workplace fun at the same time.

5514,0,CC,"<p>Hi Robert, those are some great questions.</p>
<p>1. I believe a major reason why the industry has not been able to stop insider threat from happening is because they lack a proper insider threat program. &nbsp;The knowledge of previous cases are there to support the necessity to allocate resources to this cause. &nbsp;The industry needs to have a program in place to protect them from insider threats, and they also need to have leadership support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. The industry can decrease the frequency and impact of insider threats by having a proactive approach, preparing awareness training, having a insider threat incident management plans in place, and working closely with their legal department. &nbsp;Their insider program should not just be solely technology focused, but also focused on the human aspect of insider attacks. &nbsp;After all, insider attacks are done by humans who use technology, so both components must be monitored closely. &nbsp;</p>
<p>3. If I could create one control to mitigate insider threat it would be a software that keeps track of every application, folder, document you open with a time stamp and your name, that way it acts like a finger print, tracking everywhere you touched. No one should be exempt from this program (even leadership), and the files should not be able to be edited or deleted. There should also be a team who continuously monitors the usage through this software, looking for anyone who is accessing programs/files they normally do not or should not be accessing. &nbsp;This process will come in handy when investigating insider threat as well, but will only be useful when mitigating insider threat if monitored thoroughly.&nbsp;</p>","2016-03-02 00:24:00",341,5500,C,3134,D,"Question(s) to the class",2389,NULL,53
5516,0,CC,"<p>What is everyone's opinion on this case? I believe that Apple should unlock the phone using a backdoor software to decrypt the phone and then just delete the software entirely from preventing it from leaking out especially into the wrong hands. The argument in favor of Apple is that if Apple does create this software or program to unlock the phone, then everyone's phone can be accessed. While I do agree with Anthony's quote &quot;once you open that door and walk through it, there's no going back,&quot; I believe this case presents an exigent circumstance in which the information in the phone can be used to discover other possible evidence or even other possible terror plots in the future. I do not see the harm with Apple creating this software for a one time use only and then completely wiping its existence. Bill Gates has even backed the FBI in this case stating that it is the exact same scenario as the government going to a phone company and accessing a suspect's phone records. If it is legal to gain as much information from the phone company as you would directly from the phone, why is is such a big deal if the phone is locked with a special kind of coding to access the stored information?&nbsp;</p>

<p>A question for the class in reference to AI and the Insider Threat...</p>
<p>Do you think it is possible to design an intelligent agent (essentially a computer program) that can watch over a company's workforce and discover potential insider threat? &nbsp;</p>

<p>CRYPTO IN 2016: THE STATE OF THE LAW (Thursday, March 17, 201611:00 HRS PT/14:00 HRS ET | 60 MINUTES, INCLUDING Q&amp;A)<br /></p>
<p>Strong end-to-end encryption is legal in the United States today, thanks to our victory in what's come to be known as the Crypto Wars of the 1990s. But in the wake of Paris and San Bernardino, there is increasing pressure from law enforcement and policy makers, both here and abroad, to mandate so-called backdoors in encryption products. In this presentation, I will discuss in brief the history of the first Crypto Wars, and the state of the law coming into 2016. I will then discuss the current proposals to weaken or ban encryption, covering proposed and recently enacted laws in New York, California, Australia, India, and the UK. Finally, I will discuss possible realistic outcomes to the Second Crypto Wars, and give my predictions on what the State of the Law will be at the end of 2016. <br /></p>

5582,0,CC,"<p><span style="""">I am honestly not surprised yet another Snapchat data breach has happened. This has not been the first incident where Snapchat has had a run in with the feds because of its laxed policies andvprocedures regarding their security protocols. As the article states &ldquo;Snapchat had security woes in the past a few years ago where a bug left uncheckede xposed the usernames and phone numbers of users&rdquo;. With that being said, a group of individuals decided to make an example out of Snapchat and released 4.6 million accounts just to highlight the fact that Snapchat can care less if personal data is being exposed. </span></p>
<p />
<p>Snapchat had been given numerous times to re-amp their security and yet they are still failing to meet the basic standards of how to safeguard sensitive information. They are what I like to call reactive instead of proactive. Instead of anticipating a threat and implementing policies and procedures to protect payroll information from the beginning, they are now scrambling with the FBI to protect those who have been affected. However, &nbsp;any professional who is in the field of security knows, once a person&rsquo;s information is out there, there is no getting it back. Snapchat did an injustice to their employee&rsquo;s. One of my fellow colleagues, Manuel, said it best &ldquo;in order to detect this threat there should have been more extensive monitoring of the employee's user activity. Observing what employees do on a network and what they are opening and engaging in could have helped the ITdepartment catch this threat before it happened.&rdquo; &ndash; Manuel Zevallos. Something so simple as access control and a routine system check could have avoided this, but of course since security does not bring in revenue why should CEO's care, Right? WRONG! </p>

<p><span>I&rsquo;m a firm believer in the idea that it&rsquo;s easier to exploit humans than technology.&nbsp;</span><span>Washington post article confirms that &quot;the &quot;human element&quot; was the root cause of more than half of security breaches according to a 2015&nbsp;</span><a href=""https://www.comptia.org/resources/trends-in-information-security-study""><span>report</span></a><span>&nbsp;from tech trade association CompTIA.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p />
<p><span>In this Snapchat case, determining how the attacker got the employee&rsquo;s and&nbsp;Chief Executive Evan Spiegel&rsquo;s email address can help in figuring out the ways of prevention/detection.</span></p>
<p><span>1. The attacker could be an&nbsp;insider and had access&nbsp;to company&nbsp;employee directory.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Solution</b>: an implemented Insider Threat Program could have detected or prevented this Snapchat's breach.</span></p>
<p />
<p><span>2. The attacker could be an outsider who could&nbsp;have&nbsp;guessed their emails by easily predictable email naming convention and/or gained access to company employee directory.&nbsp;Did he even have to access to&nbsp;company employee directory? No, he could have obtained knowledge using open-source intelligence, i.e. information publicly available online like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. But as the articles that Robert shared emphasize the human part, it&rsquo;s quite possible that email were obtained by a series of Social Engineering calls at reconnaissance stage of attack. Phishing itself is a prominent part of Social Engineering Framework.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Solution:</b>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>- Snapchat could have implement a strict online presence policy with minimum sharing for employees, to prevent misuse of OSINT in malicious purposes.</span></p>
<p><span>- Snapchat should have conducted frequent Social Engineering pen testing ( to improve employees' security choices and prevent social engineering attacks from causing damage).</span></p>
<p><span><br /></span></p>
<p />
<p><span>Social engineers are also called &ldquo;human hackers&rdquo;. They exploit and manipulate human nature to retrieve information that can facilitate an attack . In my opinion every company should use social engineers to test security, both internal and external.</span></p>

<p />

<p><span>Dawn Cappelli led a discussing human and technical elements of insider threat through lessons learned. &nbsp;Prior to joining Rockwell, Dawn was the founder of the Insider Threat Center and Vulnerability Management Team in CERT at Carnegie. &nbsp;She has reviewed over 800 cases and began developing methods and techniques to improve their security posture. &nbsp;<span style="""">The different types of insider threats discussed include: IT sabotage, theft of intellectual property, and fraud.</span>&nbsp; During her presentation, she mentioned you can begin an insider threat program using what you already have: audit logs, HR, and legal.&nbsp;The effectiveness of the insider threat program requires the entire organization to work together.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span
      style="""">So why the relationship with HR? There were many examples given during the presentation.<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span
        style="""">Most would not go to your Infosec specialist and as whether &ldquo;so-and-so&rdquo; has an alcohol problem, or performance, behavioral issues. &nbsp;<span
      style="""">Employees with technical or elevated privileges could end up on the HR radar due to being disgruntled or upset about an issue at work (or getting demoted, etc.).<span>&nbsp;</span></span>&nbsp;</span><span style="""">For instance, a programmer, before resigning, deployed a logic bomb that detonated two months after his departure. &nbsp;Another example: a disgruntled employee planted malicious code that deployed when their boss logged onto their computer.</span></span></p>
<p />
<p><span>Theft typically occurs within 30 days when an engineer,programmer, are on their way out the door. Typically they are going to a competitor and they are flagged to see if materials are being downloaded,copied, etc. &nbsp;The third threat occurs with modification of information is used for financial gain or espionage. &nbsp;An example of this was when a government employee falsified information to obtain legal documents for illegal immigrants (swapped photos within system). &nbsp;This person's fee ranged from $1,000-4,000 per person.</span></p>
<p><span>Detection indicators doesn't necessarily mean you need a specific application or promising &quot;whiz-bang&quot; tools to capture this type of activity. Most often, managers approach the info sec team regarding an employee that may fit a certain profile. At Rockwell, the team began using the tools already in place. When someone resigns, they review which level of access this person may have. &nbsp;If they have access to the company's &quot;crown jewels&quot; then there profile is on alert and logs are pulled to view whether downloading, copying, etc. has occurred. &nbsp;These are pulled right away since once they leave and go to a competitor, then it may be too late to recover the stolen source code, files, programs, etc. Another indicator could mean an employee begins taking certifications or courses....a few simultaneously. &nbsp;Could foreshadow that an employee is leaving soon.</span><br /></p>
<p><span>Hopefully, your organization will implement strategic change over time. &nbsp;These start with identifying your critical assets, prioritize them, use existing tools, implement training/awareness program, pilot a small program, continue to improve, deploy full scale approach. &nbsp;As your program matures, think about adding a formal governance structure, communications plan, add automated processes or data fusion/analysis, and collaborate with other organizations.</span><br /></p>

<p>I think that a few different controls could have prevented this data breach.  It is not only the technology that can cause a threat, it is also the choices that people make which is why I believe that the control of training and awareness might have allowed the staff to be more careful with who they trusted, and more resistant to believing someone's identity without proof. &nbsp;Having the staff properly trained on how to protect confidential information would have definitely helped in this case. &nbsp;<span style="""">Training would have also enabled the staff to be aware of possible insider threat situations</span></p>
<p> I believe even if it was the CEO of the company no one should just email over sensitive data like that.  There should be policies in place that require sensitive data to be handed over in person, or after proper authentication of the receiver.  Also, the role based access control would have been able to prevent low level, untrained, or untrustworthy employees from having access to sensitive data such as this in the first place.&nbsp;<br /></p>","2016-03-09 00:12:19",341,5603,C,3156,D,"We are all an inside threat",2389,NULL,53

5620,0,CC,"<p><span>Dr. Stein, thank you very much for sharing such an interesting piece. I think it&rsquo;s a great idea that literature can teach AI how to &ldquo;human&rdquo; like a boss. It&rsquo;s one of literature&rsquo;s main functions to transfer human knowledge to next generations, and it&rsquo;s quite likely that next generations are going to include large numbers of AI instances. Little human kids also do not know how to be human, and they learn acceptable patterns of behavior though reading literature as well. So it might seem like a perfect way to make AI&rsquo;s friendly members of society.</span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span>But let's have a look at Georgia Tech&rsquo;s reading approach to encode ethical values into robots&nbsp;</span><span>t</span><span>hrough the lens of Isaac Asimov's &nbsp;&quot;Three Laws of Robotics&quot;:</span></p>
<p><span><b>Law 1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.&nbsp;</b></span></p>
<p><span>A lot of literary pieces do show successful behavior patterns with no harm to humans. So it looks like Georgia Teach was focusing in this law when it came up with Quixote project. The question is if the AI would be able to draw parallels between situations and decode the metaphors or if every possible scenario will have to be &ldquo;hard-coded&rdquo; into it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span><b>Law 2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.</b></span></p>
<p><span>Good literary pieces teach us critical thinking. What readings are they going to feed into AI the encode the concept of &ldquo;obeying&rdquo;? Some religious texts? That might not work that well for this law; in the Guardian article robot HOMER16 was given The New Testament to read, and considered it a &ldquo;ludicrous set of stories&rdquo;. So it is quite doubtable that reading would convince AI&rsquo;s to obey humans.</span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span><b>Law 3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.</b></span></p>
<p><span>This is the trickiest law. Once an AI will get full awareness of self and obtains autonomy it will be impossible to predict its behavior. Assuming AI is not there yet, some literary works may successfully teach AI to die to make sure humans are not harmed, for example showing AI the pattern of a brave knight dying for a lady and attaching high scores for such actions in the decision tree.</span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span>Overall, it&rsquo;s encouraging to see new approaches in improving AI&rsquo;s cognitive and social skills. I&rsquo;m sure AI will bring a lot of benefit to humanity, as long as it&rsquo;s not self-aware and autonomous, as it&rsquo;s not in humankind&rsquo;s interest to produce AI that would behave like Ava in the movie &ldquo;Ex Machina&rdquo;.</span></p>","2016-03-09 05:22:07",341,5606,C,3154,D,"Inculcating moral values into artificial agents",2385,NULL,53

<p>Summary: Hackers used a Russian-based internet provider and made phone calls from inside Russia as part of a coordinated cyber-attack on Ukraine's power grid in December 2015. The incident was widely seen as thefirst known power outage caused by a cyberattack, and has prompted fears bothwithin Ukraine and outside that other critical infrastructure could bevulnerable. It had completed an investigation into the incident, did not accusethe Russian government directly of involvement in the attack.</p>

<p>As a follow-up to this evening's class, I wanted to share a few sentiments:&nbsp;<br /><br />1. &nbsp;There are several different ways to approach risk management. &nbsp;I took a risk management class a few years ago; on the first day of class, the professor told me that risk management has failed every single time in preventing and detecting a financial crisis. &nbsp;The point was that risk management is not an exact science; it's not a panacea. &nbsp;It's an educated effort to help manage risk with finite resources and time. &nbsp;Tonight we talked about some very high-level concepts in risk management, including inherent risk, (compensating) controls, residual risk, and others. &nbsp;Following industry best practices is a good place to start, but understand it's not a binary process. &nbsp;Don't be afraid to think about risk differently or explore new methods for assessing, mitigating, and managing risk. &nbsp;<br /><span><br /><span>2. &nbsp;There are many mentors involved in this internship; there are also vendors and professors. &nbsp;Everyone involved brings unique experiences and insights; the breadth and depth of our collective perspectives are what's invaluable to this initiative. &nbsp;There may be times where we provide differing or contradictory guidance or direction. &nbsp;This happens in academia and it'll continue to happen in any field you pursue. &nbsp;My advice on how to handle it: &nbsp;weigh and measure all sources of information, determine their value, and execute. &nbsp;If you can defend a position and the logic behind the team's decisions, you will be on solid ground. &nbsp;In the following weeks, you will continue to hear from many different individuals, so I want the class to keep this in mind; maintain an open mind, own your insider threat programs, and remember: &nbsp;any idea is better than no idea, but the best idea wins.&nbsp;<br /></span></span><span><br />3. &nbsp;Personally, I'd like to see more collaboration between the teams. &nbsp;It's not a competition; there is no money involved (that I'm aware of). &nbsp;The collective class will greatly benefit from everyone's ideas and input. &nbsp;Don't repeat the mistakes of our intelligence community in the U.S. and hoard information. &nbsp;It's only by sharing information, collaborating, and putting forth individual insights that the class as a whole will succeed. &nbsp; You're all talented, motivated, and engaged as teams. &nbsp;Think about branching out and how you can help each other. &nbsp;<span style="""">Excellence is not an individual effort.<span>&nbsp;</span></span><br /></span><span><br />4. &nbsp;Keep the questions coming. &nbsp;Keep asking until it makes sense to you. &nbsp;You've all come a long way in a short amount of time; you have even further to go before you reach the final presentations. &nbsp;We are all here to help the class succeed. &nbsp;I'm encouraged by what I have seen so far; keep up the good work, everyone!</span></p>","2016-03-10 03:47:25",341,3203,D,NULL,NULL,"Class follow-up - Week 5 (March 9, 2016)",2249,"2016-03-15 18:51:16",51

<p>I'll let Rose follow up on this, but I wanted to share a quick story from a conference I was at the other day. &nbsp;The CIO for <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/company/d&amp;m-holdings"">D+M group</a> gave a presentation about his company's utilization of the cloud. &nbsp;He stated that his company has not bought a single server in the past 4 years, which was pretty shocking to me. &nbsp;Their core infrastructure, services, and security are out-sourced/cloud-based; it works for his company. &nbsp;<br /><span><br /><span>That's clearly not the case for the financial industry (critical functions are not hosted on the cloud), but other industries are moving or have already moved to the cloud. &nbsp;The financial industry has more regulatory and statutory oversight than the music industry, so it's challenging to compare the two. &nbsp;Just food for thought.</span></span></p>","2016-03-10 04:07:11",341,5623,C,3191,D,"Proactive Measures to Mitigate Insider Threat",2249,NULL,51

I think this is possible to prefect and the researchers are on the right path but the difficult part i would imagine is being able to identify the emotion and the intent of language. Intent is something that everyone has an incredibly difficult time figuring out and due to this i think a human component of risk mitigation would still need to be developed. Without an understanding of different cultures and how each word is used and the background of the language, the history and why it is being used could cause several errors.&nbsp;</p>

5665,0,CC,"<p>Hi!</p>
<p><span>Whitelisting- Basically it's another way to prevent unauthorized programs from running. There are different types of whitelists and my prior organization used LAN whitelist in addition to app which filter by MAC and subnets (after using bulk network encryption devices to prevent spoofing).<span>&nbsp;</span>Your question refers to using a list of approved applications.&nbsp;When the application runs, the list verifies whether the program isallowed to execute. An integrity check is conducted to ensure it is the actual application and not one with the same name. By minimizing access, viruses andmalware are reduced. Blacklisting is the opposite. &nbsp;This is a list of unapproved applications which are prevented from running. This is typically used at the network perimeter. For example, you add the unwanted IP or URL and it's blocked at your firewall or using bluecoat proxy.</span></p>
<p><span>Maintaining both lists may become tedious and requires constant maintenance as business requirements evolve or become more complex. Some argue it may limit the end user productivity while others say it gives you more controls within your network.<span>&nbsp; </span>To be effective, the organization should have an understanding of their assets and understand the vulnerabilities that impact them.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span>Your second question is more complex and I don&rsquo;t have extensive knowledge surrounding SaaS and PaaS.<span>&nbsp; </span>From my experience with a firm, it&rsquo;s dependent on the business needs and how they want to tailor service and delivery models around business recovery time objectives, information security, cost, and privacy. <span>&nbsp;</span>Although the firm may have a deployed a cloudsolution, the challenges remain with regulatory and compliance. For instance, I have seen revised cloud strategies regarding where data sits and whether their client&rsquo;s information (global) is transferred cross-border. After extensive &ldquo;lawyering&rdquo; to policies it may transferred at the consent of the client or all processing is conducted within the borders of that country (depends on the country&rsquo;s privacy laws). </span></p>
<p><span>Asfar as the second part, could you clarify a bit more?<span>&nbsp; </span>Are you asking because of hybrid cloud solutions there will be a decrease of the IT workforce?&nbsp;</span></p>","2016-03-11 21:43:30",341,5647,C,3191,D,"Proactive Measures to Mitigate Insider Threat",2411,NULL,51

<p>&lt;quote&gt; <i>Gopal Padinjaruveetil finds philosophy fascinating. In his free time, he reads about Western philosophies such as utilitarianism, individualism, objectivism, social contract theories and Eastern philosophies such as Vedanta. It is this curiosity about philosophy and human nature that led Padinjaruveetil to pursue a career in&nbsp;cyber-security. &ldquo;My background in and a passion for organization behavior and human behavior helped me understand the&nbsp;human elements of cybersecurity,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;With that understanding, I am able to apply the Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) certification in a much more pragmatic way</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Today in Physics, scientists are looking for a unifying theory that&rsquo;s explains the Universe, that makes sense of both the Classical Physics and Quantum Physics and also the Nature of Reality.</p>
<p>Similarly in the area of Human Behavior, The western world will soon start looking for a unifying theory that connects Human Mind, Human Consciousness,Human Thinking , Human Behavior, and Human Action (what we do). The good news is this problem and also the previous on the Nature of Reality has been solved by the Eastern Philosophy called Vedanta, which dates back to more than 5000+years ago. To give you a small peek into this abundant knowledge on human behavior and its connection to <span>&nbsp;</span>our Human Body, Human Mind and Human Intellect.. please take a look at this slides</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/baskaranpurushothaman/explanation-of-vedanta-with-bmi-chart"">http://www.slideshare.net/baskaranpurushothaman/explanation-of-vedanta-with-bmi-chart</a></p>
<p>The word Om or Super Consciousness is what Dr Neil Theise was talking in my previous post. The Super Consciousness is connected to the individual Body, Mind and Intellect through this word or concept called &ldquo;Vasana&rdquo;,The equivalent concept from the Western science would be the Genetic signatures that we acquire through our birth and from our parents and ancestors. You are born with a set of basic and fundamental signatures that determine &ldquo;who you are&rdquo;and your, thinking behavior and action, but the eastern thinking is this signature can be modified by us through very prescriptive methods called meditation and mindfulness(Zen). The fundamental difference in ancient eastern thinking and the current western thinking in solving the human thinking and Behavior is the eastern philosophy thinks that answer lies within you and you can unlock your infinite potential through Introspection, whereas the western thinking is the answers lies outside.</p>
<p>If you look at the 20th century giants like Niels Bohr,Erwin Schrodinger, Nikola Tesla and Albert Einstein (and there are many more)there thinking and works were greatly inspired by Eastern Vedanta thinking</p>

<p>Now if you look at the 21st century gaints like SteveJobs,Andrew Weil MD, Elvis Presley,<span>&nbsp; </span>MarcBenioff (Salesforce), Neil Theise MD, Vilayanur S. Ramachandran MD ( Departmentof Psychology and the Graduate Program in Neurosciences at the University of California, San Diego) they were also inspired by eastern Vedanta.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs in his autobiography says the he Read the book Autobiography of a Yogi &quot;first read it as a teenager, then re-read it in India and had read it once a year<span>&nbsp; </span>ever since&quot; it is said this was the ONLY book he had on his iPad. </p>
<p>Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce.com, told this story of attending Steve Jobs memorial service, where the attendees were handed a small brown box on their way out. &quot;This is going to be good,&quot; he thought.&quot;I knew that this was a decision he made, and whatever it was, it was the last thing he wanted us all to think about.&quot; The box contained a copy of Paramahansa Yogananda's book, Autobiography of a Yogi.</p>
<p>In the last slide of the link above on Vedanta, you will see a triangle explaining the various levels of our brain and thinking Physical, Conscious,Pre- Conscious, Sub Conscious and Conscious the last three is what is known asThe Hidden Brain. To know more about your hidden brain and how key it to understand human behavior and the decisions we make, please read the book <b>The Hidden Brain: How Our Unconscious Minds Elect Presidents, Control Markets, Wage Wars, and Save Our Lives</b> by Shankar Vedantam.</p>
<p>Long story short, For any serious student who wants to learn and understand the Human Mind, Human Consciousness, Human Thinking, Human Behavior, Human Action(the things we do) in any context be it Business,Cyber-security, Politics, or even your own life , the real answers does not lie in the WEST, it lies in the EAST.. (hope fully this gives any serious student ahead start !!)</p>
<p>The same is true in another emerging area of cutting edge<span>&nbsp; </span>Information Technology .. Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, To understand what is Reality the real answers does not lie in the WEST, it lies in the EAST.</p>
<p>The same is true with another emerging area of cutting edge<span>&nbsp; </span>Information Technology, Big Data and Predictive Analytic, in the area of Cognitive Bias.. to know more please read.. <b>The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail-but Some Don't by Nate Silver</b>, he talks about Quantitative and Cognitive Bias, but to understand the source of the various cognitive bias,the real answers does not lie in the WEST, it lies in the EAST</p>","2016-03-12 17:22:11",342,5656,C,3155,D,"Inculcating moral values into artificial agents",2289,NULL,51

<p>I recently attended a fireside chat for current events in cybersecurity hosted by the Aspen Institute @ Hunter College with <i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;chief Washington correspondent David Sanger, Senior Research Scholar in cyber conflict at Columbia University Jason Healy, and Assistant Secretary for Cybersecurity and Communications at the Department of Homeland Security Dr. Andy Ozment leading the informative panel.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>During the panel, Dr. Ozment seamlessly broke down the 5 Types of Cyber Criminals:</span><br /></p>
<p><span>1. Vandals: small offense criminals who mess with the visuals of a website, cyber&nbsp;</span>interface</p>
<p><span>2. Burglers: criminals who seek money via illegal wire transfers, data tapping, etc.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Thugs: criminals who seek to damage the image and integrity of a corporation via cyber tampering</span></p>
<p><span>4. <b>Spies: </b>criminals who seek to pilfer intellectual property from government and large private entities</span></p>
<p>5.&nbsp;<b>Saboteurs</b><b>:&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;criminals who infiltrate integral systems, then lay and wait until the system of a rather important &nbsp;corporation or&nbsp;government entities is most vulnerable</p>
<p>The last two criminals, Dr. Ozment highlighted, are the most dangerous and frankly speaking, the DHS in addition to other government entities (DoD, NSA, etc) are still&nbsp;trying to figure out the most effective way in&nbsp;detecting these cyber criminals, especially those of insider threat background. Ozment also added that more&nbsp;interdisciplinary collaborations between risk, IS,&nbsp;compliance, and behavioral&nbsp;analysts need to be made to find best&nbsp;practices for finding these criminals.</p>
<p>My question for the group would be since our class is already&nbsp;structured to&nbsp;utilize the best of each of our assigned skills have to offer, how can we be more&nbsp;interdisciplinary in our practices so that we can develop and implement&nbsp;methods to track down&nbsp;insider threat based cyber criminals.</p>

5710,0,CC,"<p>I think that the use of Appreciative Inquiry could be very helpful for assisting to define the scope of the problem in the fullest form possible. Since many of the groups (including my own) have taken the standpoint of being a consulting firm, it is proving extremely difficult to try to define all of the risks a company faces, especially since many different types of companies could potentially work with totally different technologies that have different vulnerabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the 3:00 session Tom spoke about how many companies are moving away from using different types of risk assessments as it is creating a science for something that cannot necessarily be measured, and this is a concept I have considered thoroughly throughout break: How is it possible that we measure the &quot;risk&quot; of a company if there is no way to measure if these vulnerabilities would be acted upon, and if we jump to these conclusions to &quot;problem solve&quot; we may lose sight of the true problems a company faces</p>
<p>.I definitely think that this is something our team will consider implementing to help us reach our end goal. While the quantitative portions of a risk assessment prove important to a company when pitching, I also think that focusing on the positive things a company is doing will work more efficiently than just focusing on what is wrong (as the Harvard article went through). Also, as for Insider Threat specifically, getting the employees involved in security turnarounds is extremely beneficial to the purpose of the program--as the insiders are the risk. Beyond just a risk, employees who do not feel engaged in a positive manner in the workplace will probably be more apathetic, or even feel scrutinized, when implementing policies that are so negatively focused. This makes me think back to one of the first articles we read on how disgruntled employees are more likely to commit these crimes.</p>
<p>I see these ideas being implemented into our policy proposals going forward, and helping us allow our scope to be broadened to consider positives more heavily, and how focusing on those positives can strengthen both directly those that were strong to begin with and indirectly the areas that needed to be improved upon.<br /></p>","2016-03-16 23:24:06",342,5679,C,3218,D,"Student Assignment Challenge: On Defining the Scope of Problem",2400,NULL,53

<p>Petr brings up an important point when he mentions numbers and statistics. &nbsp;From a criminal justice perspective, it's interesting that the survey appears to look at victimization data. &nbsp;While victimization data is seen as better than officially reported data, it would be informative if there was self report surveys open to cyber criminals. &nbsp;While the data collected from these surveys have inherent flaws, additional data can provide a more comprehensive view.</p>

<p><span>My first reaction was that this company&rsquo;s HR department might be totally ignoring red flags in the hiring process. The hacker has already shown his malicious side and is an obvious insider threat for the organization.

They could have potentially stolen $1 Billion dollars but were unsuccessful due to a spelling error during the transfer. Hackers transferred money to three casino operators in the Philippines which are not subject to anti-money-laundering laws.

<p>I recognized the network topology from our syllabus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not expert either, but I agree with Teresa that the placement of the firewall it&rsquo;s redundant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why does Legal department and HR need access to the E-trading system?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, a firewall it&rsquo;s usually placed after a router not a switch, unless it&rsquo;s a multilayer switch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d setup the network in different way. After the second router, I&rsquo;d place a switch, implement VLANs, so only those authorized to use the E-trading system have access to it and place an IDS between the switch and the E-trading system. No second firewall it's necessary I believe.</p>

<p>&lt;Note: Just because a policy is set at a high level, it &nbsp;does not mean it applies to board or senior management only.&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span><b>Information Security Standards</b></span></p>
<p>Standards are the set of baseline controls that are defined to ensure a minimum level ofsecurity controls required to maintain an acceptable level of risk. Information Security Standards detailthe requirements necessary to comply with the Information Security Policy. The Information SecurityCompany's Standards may be&nbsp;based on standards such as ISO 27002 </p>
<p>&nbsp;<span><b>Information Security Procedures</b></span></p>
<p>Procedures spell out the specifics of how the policy and the supporting standards are actually implemented in the operating environment. Information Security Procedures are developed to provide guidance or insight into how Information Security Standard requirements are or may be implemented. Information Security Procedures may be specific to how an Information Security Programperforms its work,Issue Specific Procedures, or Platform Hardening Procedures.

<p>I'm sure there are legal consequences to this, too. Shows again how important employee training really is because any company is only as strong as its weakest link, and in most cases it would be such employees that are willing to sell their password for&nbsp;&pound;700.&nbsp;</p>

I do not think that machines would ever be able to completely be able to learn human behavior because a lot of human behavior is not always explainable. There is not always a reason that someone behaves a certain way so programming a machine to be able to pick up on that would definitely be troublesome, therefore, there may be a fundamental flaw. I also do not think that a machine could completely replace human cyber security personnel. I do think that it could definitely be extremely helpful in red flagging things that are done on the computer or the slow leakage of information from a company by an employee but when it comes to red flags that are evident in someone's behavior that's recognized through direct interaction with them would not be picked up on by the machine. Humans would be needed to work alongside the machines to make sure that all the bases are covered which I think would definitely lead to a stronger team.&nbsp;</p>","2016-03-28 20:29:04",342,5767,C,3155,D,"Inculcating moral values into artificial agents",2364,NULL,53

5814,0,CC,"<p>There are many potentially fruitful approaches to diagnosing and understanding the Tay debacle and other related AI attempts at programing computers to learn to solve word problems and interact in plain language. <span>&nbsp;</span>But focusing on the style of language is missing the central function of language: communication.<span>&nbsp; Formality or s</span>lang or whatever is not the issue.<span>&nbsp; <br /></span></p>
<p>This could be a hugely broad discussion. Let&rsquo;s stay focused on the slivers particularly relevant to cybersecurity: psycholinguistics.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>Language-oriented behavioral analytics attempt to recognize the significance of speech acts or language-inputs.<span>&nbsp;</span>Red flags which are written or uttered.<span>&nbsp;</span>This analysis is typically derived from examining patterns established over a span of time and against baseline parameters of normality and acceptability.<br /></p>
<p>There are gigantic limitations to this general approach.<span>&nbsp;</span>Certainly analysis of what people say, the words they use, is important, and presents a field of relevant data which holds the potential to signal a variety of possible risk factors.<span>&nbsp; </span>But, most significantly, how do we INTERPRET the data of human communication?<span>&nbsp; </span>What might be the distinguishing factors between, say, hostile musings (or ideation) and imminent lawless action?<span>&nbsp; </span>What are the indicators of behavioral propensities or planned actions?<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>People often say things they don&rsquo;t necessarily mean.<span>&nbsp; </span>People also don&rsquo;t always know themselves what they mean or how their speech acts are being received.<span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;</span>And very often in communicating people reveal (or conceal) much more than they realize or are aware of.</p>
<p>The core here is hermeneutics: the interpretation of meaning.<span>&nbsp; </span>A fatal drawback to conventional metrics-oriented or event-based linguistic analysis is deriving conclusions about what people say just from what they say.<span>&nbsp; </span>Far more significant is understanding what they mean.<span>&nbsp; </span>Which is frequently at a variance to what&rsquo;s said (or written). <span>&nbsp;</span>Or understanding the means by which people attempt to deflect or hide what they mean. <span>&nbsp;</span>I consider these the &ldquo;shadow narratives&rdquo;.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>My input is: don't get tied up on issues of style or dialect.<span>&nbsp; </span>Instead, pay close attention to all that people communicate but DON&rsquo;T say and all that they are saying underneath what they seem to be saying.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>","2016-03-29 18:27:09",342,5776,C,3187,D,"making machines better at understanding language",2247,NULL,51

<p>Three points stand out to us when developing an insider threat program:</p>
<p>1. You need to have as much quantitative information as possible so you can attempt to measure the risk in your organizations. (Knowing who has what access, what is valuable, what risky behavior your employees are exhibiting and much more information is necessary).</p>
<p>2. You need to understand what information is important based on context. (I don't care as much if an HR Employee is handling Social Security Numbers, but I do care if an IT Employee is working with large amounts of SSN).</p>
<p>3. You need to have a program that after measuring where you are at, has measures for improvement so you can &quot;move the needle.&quot;</p>

<p><span>One program I believe everyone knows about would be a security awareness program. One company we work with wanted to measure how many policy violations their employees create (mishandling sensitive data, visiting non-reputable IT sites, etc.). They then wanted to automate the training process whenever an employee broke a policy by sending an email informing them why it puts the company at risk or giving them a video to watch depending on the severity.</span><br /></p>
<p>This resulted in a 70% reduction in employee policy violations. By knowing what to measure and what put the company at risk, they could improve their &quot;risk posture.&quot;</p>
<p>Another program example would a vulnerability management program<span style=""""><span>&nbsp;- which in</span>&nbsp;theory is simple, but in practice can be very challenging. Common metrics include how many vulnerabilities do I have? Although, that is not most effective form of measurement.

5843,0,CC,"<p>I agree with everything you said Max. I knew that the FBI would gain access to the phone one way or another. Throughout the entire arguments, I was always in favor of the FBI - I believe that the concern for public safety against terrorist threats like we have here in San Bernandino should be more of a priority over privacy matters. To me, the FBI gaining access to the phone from a third party tells me that privacy is not fully secure, ever. Where are all the people now that were concerned with the government accessing the phone being able to access everyone's phones? Since the news came out that they have accessed the phone I have seen that many people stopped talking about the case and protesters have diminished throughout. Because a third party can crack into most likely any phone it is okay but if the government would try to do it then people believe they would gain too much power? I see no one arguing against the third party cracking into the phone but really what is the difference between the third party being able to bypass the code and the government.

What kind of message does this send to the public? If they pressured Apple into agreeing, citizens would be worried and upset over privacy and security. If they got in (or, now that they have gotten in) they'd look like they were making a big deal out of nothing and panicking rather than keeping a cool head.

5845,0,CC,"<p>Thanks everyone for the great comments.&nbsp; IMO this only kicks the can the down the proverbial road.&nbsp; Interestingly enough, the Intelligence Community including the CIA was actually cautioning against forcing Apple to bypass its security.&nbsp; Nobody truly believed that the crack would only be used one time and there was the concern that oppressive regimes looking to further crack on dissidents or even US intelligence personnel would be put at risk.&nbsp; What happens for example when China, Russia or&nbsp;Iran require that Apple provide backdoor access as a condition to selling the iPhone in their markets? Besides,&nbsp;a knowledgeable criminal wanting to secure their communications have many choices of encryption &nbsp;tools today that are far more advanced than the 4 digit passcode.&nbsp; Apple is going to continue to strengthen its security and encryption (likely including allowing customers to encrypt icloud backups with their own private keys).&nbsp;&nbsp; Forcing backdoors that bypass are generally a bad idea that could result in even great threats to national and global security and freedom.&nbsp; </p>

5855,3,CD,"<p>Dear all Cyberintern Teams,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Good afternoon, yesterday as Mr.Francis said in class, our final presentation will consist of at least 1 member from each team to present 1 of the team's insider threat program to the industry. I believe to prepare for this we should have 1 video next week, in addition to the regular 3 videos we all upload, that consists of 1 member from each team, to present 1 of the team's assignment for next week. I don't believe it will be a lot of extra work, because the information will just be aggregated from each team as we go through the week and build our individual assignments, the only extra work is picking a team's &nbsp;assignment and filming it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To me I feel this is the best way to prepare for the final presentation, so we aren't all scrambling to adjust to each other on how to work together (if conflicts may arise, etc.) I believe if we didn't try a test run like this, and waited for the final presentation to work together, it would sort of be equivalent to the work we did back in Week 1 since it would basically a new team working together. (Side Note: There may have been something Mr.Francis said to prepare for the final presentation, but I don't exactly recall what it was, if anyone or Mr.Francis himself can repeat what was said, I would appreciate it.) &nbsp;Especially since as week goes by, we are a week closer to finals, which we all saw how pressed we were for time around midterms. Maybe we can do this once every other week and the mentors can give us a response on that additional video? It doesn't have to be in-depth as the responses to our individual assignments are, but the more feedback, the more we can work with.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Let me know what you all think. Thank you for your time and have a nice day.</p>

<p>I found this video on YouTube where this top hacker at a convention explains the different ways he can hack into almost anything connected to the internet. It is actually kind of scary because of just how much he can do.

Tell me what you guys think!</p>

David Brumley's &quot;three ways to get started&quot; include to stop stigmatizing hackers, recognize cybersecurity as a uniquely skilled profession, and start building cybersecurity into basic curricula. When ever I watch or read anything about &quot;hackers&quot; on the news the stigma is always negative. This is not always the case because there are some &quot;hackers&quot; who hack for good which is not easily seen by the people. Regarding the recognition of cybersecurity as a skilled profession, I can believe that it would be working right now because of the fact that we can see the increase in job hiring in the field due to the fact there are so many jobs that or open to these type of professionals. Lastly building cybersecurity into basic curricula can also be seen today because it has in fact been implemented here at UAlbany. The informatics department only last year created the cybersecurity concentration which is a fact that schools are beginning to implement cybersecurity curricula.</p>","2016-04-07 16:28:37",342,5914,C,3262,D,"Hacker Allies?",2375,NULL,53

The thing is it may be for the the good of the people however when the government takes away basic rights of the people that can lead to even more rights being broken. I'm not saying that the government is going to track everyone and everyone's rights are going to be broken.

<p>since we are working together towards the final presentation, here is my input:</p>
<p>I believe your case study is IT sabotage. The GNB employed a contractor as a night time security guard who was basically a hacker. Here, GNB failed to run background check. The measures that could be put in place are for example: vetting process, contract between 3rd party contractors, NDA ...</p>
<p>Did he needed access to the e-trading system? Wasn't he supervised?</p>
<p>The contractor used malware. Did GNB had antimalware installed on all their systems?</p>
<p>The GNB didn't have contingency plan hence the four hour outage accross the enterprise.</p>

5953,0,CC,"<p>I think what makes these companies more tempting to attackers during mergers is that during these mergers there are so many moving parts that it is easy to overlook or under protect some areas. This causes the issue of cybersecurity to become some what of an afterthought to be dealt with once the merger deal is complete. This is an obvious disadvantage and can become costly because during these mergers they have an increase of attackers from outside of the company along with an increase of potential insider threats. During this time it would be logical to increase protection efforts but they don't.&nbsp;<span>As the article Dr. Stein posted shows, these companies have no defense against these attacks because they simply ignore cybersecurity. Another article I read shows that this issue was even worse around four years ago as only about a third of companies considered cybersecurity when the planning of a merger was occurring. That is a great difference from today since these days about 60% of the companies actually get the cybersecurity teams involved during the planning. This is better but there is still a large number of companies that make themselves highly vulnerable during mergers and this is an issue that still needs to be addressed.&nbsp;</span></p>

5995,0,CC,"<p>Hey Rob,</p>

<p>Even though Mossack Fonseca and GNB are in two different industries they both store very sensitive information about their clients. Mossack Fonseca claims that their leak was made public by an <a href=""http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/panama-papers-leak-not-inside-job-mossack-fonseca-claims-servers-were-hacked-abroad-1553439"">outside hacker</a> and not anyone inside the organization.</p>
<p>Consequently, we could use this to our advantage and show GNB that the extent of the damage from an outside source can be very harmful to the company. If an insider who has access to more files and can go undetected for a longer period of time can probably cause permanent devastation to GNB.</p>
<p>In this case based on our program we would definitely need to focus on the use of privileges and network traffic. Logs need to be checked to make sure that the person in charge knows what is being used, when, where, and how. Since this leak was 2TB, it was said that it could not have been possible to send information through emails. Somehow they managed to do it and take it, which leaves me to believe that either it could have been an inside job or someone physically came in and stole the files while no one was there. Either way security was not enforced the way it should have been and it affected its clients and most likely will keep affecting others as more files come to light. <br /></p>","2016-04-11 14:38:36",341,5961,C,3302,D,"Panama Papers Leak",2383,NULL,53

I'm sure everyone is &quot;relieved&quot; now because finally, all the super important conversations with our friends are finally secure from &quot;Big brother's eavesdropping&quot; }smirk emoji{ However, my personal opinion is that for most part this should not really affect most whatsapp users, unless they are using it for some illegal activities.

Only in case when&nbsp;&quot;pirate-reverse engineer&quot; is also a good programmer, he can modify the extracted code according to the principle of complementarity. In other words, if a pirate (at the same time brilliant programmer) will record the printer sounds, will get some photos of the potential product (made by an insider), plus will steal binaries files (in successful hacker attack), there is no doubt that everything will turn out.

6035,0,CC,"<p>Hi Teresa,</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good question, but I don&rsquo;t think that placing another firewall at HR would solve the problem. To prevent data loss, there are other controls that could be implemented. For example, USB and CD drives on all the systems would be disabled, strong BYOD policy, applying least privilege and separation of duties, network scanning tools such as Nessus could identify if someone is sending PII over the network, antimalware solutions on all the computers, etc.</p>
<p>Regarding the social engineering, a proxy server or firewall rules could be set to prevent users from visiting certain websites.</p>
<p>Education and awareness training, the above mentioned controls and the firewall between the two routers would keep company sensitive information &ldquo;safe&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>

6043,0,CC,"<p>Think of this in terms of *compartmentalization.&quot;&nbsp; You want to protect the things that are most valuable to our company, and use protection strategies that are in line with the risk that you want to mitigate.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information (PII), like your HR records, should be very well protected, but a mature organization would be very unlikely to put PII in the same compartment as trade information - they're different businesses, they have different risk profiles, and the people and systems that require the highest level of privilege to get to HR data and Trade data will likely be different individuals.</p>
<p>Firewalls are one form of protection, but they're not the only form of protection.&nbsp; If you want to compartmentalize your sensitive information, crown jewels, and high risk systems to &quot;must have access&quot; systems and people, you can build your logical compartments to achieve this.</p>
<p>Consider the levels of restriction and types of protections that you can deploy:</p>
<p>*&nbsp; You can limit people-to-system connectivity</p>
<p>*&nbsp; You can limit system-to-system connectivity</p>
<p>*&nbsp; You can limit compartment-to-compartment connectivity</p>
<p>*&nbsp; You can require multi-factor-auth to protect against exploit of stolen credentials</p>
<p>*&nbsp; You can require physical access to machines and systems to make certain types of changes</p>
<p>*&nbsp; You can enable whitelist and blacklist infrastructure</p>

The key in this sentence is &quot;up-and-coming.&quot; It means that it is a new field, so unknown factors should exist. It should seem like a daunting task because these attackers have had a head start in the 'game'. However, I do believe Steve Santorelli has 'given up' too soon. We can see sharp increases because people who are likely to abuse their internet privileges are learning that they can take advantage of the system. When the trained individuals respond and try to mitigate risks and threats, every attack is practice. We learn from every 'weakness.' Is it a painful learning process? It can be. That does not mean it is impossible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally speaking, we are paying more attention to this type of crime. It should be expected that there will be a higher number of cases to review. For example, pretend that UAlbany is conducting research about theft on campus. They implement new security systems and enforce rules. They are taking active steps to protect the student body. At the same time, they are catching the thieves. Therefore, it would seem like there is a drastic increase in crime on campus.

<p>I think the FDIC was very lucky to get the data back that was stolen. The important information like that shouldn't really be easy to get, and download. Even though they had a data loss protection software in place in order to detect any types of data loss they should had policies that would had prevented this type of incident. Like in APT-2 insider program we have policies that will help prevent this types of incidents like the use of unauthorized external hardrives/flash sticks, and role based/least privilege so employees won't be able to access certain files if it's not in there job description. Also the timely deletion of employee creditals so they can't log into the system. I think if banks or other companies implement these policies it will help prevent future incidents like these.</p>","2016-04-16 03:26:05",341,6035,C,3329,D,"What Banks Can Learn from the FDIC Data Breach",2390,NULL,53

In a day and age where technology plays such a major role in everyday life, and does so because it has Internet capabilities, it would be very difficult to have a world without it. Although I agree that hackers are one step ahead I also believe that there will always be someone who is better so it is important to try to be as diligent as possible in order to have an advantage over hackers, however, I think that it is close to impossible to be a step ahead of all of them. I also believe that as time progresses better strategies of identifying and preventing any risk will be developed that would help tackle any risk that arises.&nbsp;</p>","2016-04-17 03:08:08",342,6044,C,3308,D,"Former Scotland Yard Senior Detective and ex MS guru says not much hope for the future of the Internet",2364,NULL,53

<p>1) Obviously he has tremendous experience in this field that has given him insights and wisdom to make a comment like that..&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) I believe when he said there is &quot;no hope for internet&quot; &nbsp;I am sure he meant there is no hope for the current version of the Internet.. Not the future of Technology that connects people, businesses, devices, intelligence.. Let's say you own a first version T Model of a mechanical Automobile, you have made many enhancements over it over the years.. Do you see a future for that version still in 2016, or is it time to replace it with a much enhanced version that can run on the Autobahns of Germany? What about other modes a mechanical automobile like an Aeroplane, Rockets? .. or would you keep arguing that we still need to maintain the T Model and not progress ?</p>
<p>There are many in the industry feel hat the we have overloaded the current internet (technology) &nbsp;too much (originally meant for connecting devices and sending Hyper Text).. and to say there is not much hope for the current implementation of internet.. just like jet travel and Space X people are working on the next version of &quot;Internet&quot;.. for example I dont know if you have heard about the new type of internet like technology called BlockChain..</p>
<p>If you google for the &quot;Future of Internet&quot;.. You will see some amazing thought leadership articles videos..</p>

<p><i>&quot;Companies must do more to address their <b>yawning accountability gap</b>, before they find themselves in the headlines&quot;</i><br /></p>
<p><span>I am interested in the human behavioral dynamics of &quot;Accountability&quot; and the complexities on fixing accountability in a Cyber context..</span><br /></p>
<p><span>Webster Definition of Accountability:<i> &quot;The quality or state of being accountable; especially : an obligation or willingness to accept responsibility or to account for one's actions or one's inaction&quot;</i></span></p>
<p>The human nature of accountability when something goes wrong either because of your&nbsp;decision or&nbsp;indecision or your action or your inaction is the key aspect here from a Cyber security perspective.</p>
<p>Is there a relationship between Accountability and Self Incrimination in negative outcomes..&nbsp;</p>
<p>Self-incrimination is the act of exposing oneself (generally, by making a statement) &quot;to an accusation or charge of crime; to involve oneself or another [person] in a criminal prosecution or the danger thereof. Many legal systems, accused criminals cannot be compelled to incriminate themselves.</p>
<p>My question who is responsible &quot;TO DO MORE TO ADDRESS THE ACCOUNTABILITY GAP&quot; ? is it the Companies or the regulators (the enforcement agencies).. If it is the companies, what motivation do they have.. a Moral one?</p>
<p><span>If an executive or board's action or <b>INACTION </b>led to an Cyber Incident in which a Customer Data was breached should there be criminal/Civil&nbsp;</span>culpability (accountability ) (under the&nbsp;definition&nbsp;of&nbsp;a white collar crime<span>? ). If the answer is Yes.&nbsp;</span><span>wouldn't</span><span>&nbsp;the US Constitution's Fifth Amendment Apply?&nbsp;</span><br /></p>
<p><span>In a cyber crime scenario.. There are 3 parties involved.. The&nbsp;</span>Perpetrator of the Crime (Insider or External), The Organization, and its external stakeholders (Customers).. Who is the Victim here? (the organization or the&nbsp;customer&nbsp;or both) if the organization is a victim of the crime.. can they (victims) be held accountable?</p>

<p>Very interesting article that actually shed light on the actual state of affairs in computer security of major financial institutions. First it turns out that FDIC employees can keep their personal files (photos of family!!! and resume) on the hard drives of their workstations!!! If it is so easy to download pictures, they can simply download a Trojan or a sniffer, which can make a lot damage before IDS will discover what is going on.&nbsp;Second, to be honest, I do not understand how it was possible that she <span

6094,0,CC,"<p>This is great because it reduces human error and also contributes on off hours. the main part that i believe is important is the collaboration between Ai and humans because they can over look each other when on does not see something, the other does. This creates a dynamic duo between AI and hums. One thing that would directly affect the organization that implements using AI's is the reduction o an attack happening. I can also say that I agree with Brendan in that the behavioral aspect of the insider threat would be something that the Ai would not be able to detect in which case leaving the human to assess patterns while also interviewing employees and making sure terminated employees have no access to the company. One thing that would eventually be brought up to attention would be is the Ai taking jobs and reducing the chances of employment for those who are experts in what they do?</p>","2016-04-20 21:39:23",342,6068,C,3338,D,"MIT is Teaching AI How to Help Stop Cyberattacks",2376,NULL,53

Could companies use regular analysts to check the computer reports? This would minimize error from both instruments and humans.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Additionally, how can companies be sure that they can protect this system if they are using this system to protect against the original system? It seems too risky at this point. What if the company tried to use AI to detect threats when they have perfected/created an alternative threat detection method?

6131,0,CC,"<p>There are Three Key Resources that I want to highlight here for your final presentation</p>
<p>1) <b>John Squires Presentation</b> : The Legal Dimension of Insider Threat</p>
<p>2) <b>Dr Alexander Stein's Presentation </b>: The Human Dimension of Insider Threat</p>
<p>3) <b>Matthew William's Presentation (Bay Dynamics)</b> : The Technology Dimension of Insider threat</p>
<p>In my humble opinion this three resources is all you need to make a great final presentation on Insider Threat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is another dimension that I believe is important, that is the Governance Dimension, but I strongly believe that is within the confines of the above three dimensions : The Invisible Dimension&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I don't use the term Dimension lightly, We live in a three (visible) and one (invisible) dimension world (The invisible dimension being the Space and Time dimension introduced by Einstein with his Theory of Relativity).&nbsp;</p>
<p>To truly understand the beauty , the importance and limitations of the Dimensions, you need to read this this book</p>
<p>&quot;Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions&quot; an 1884 satirical novella by English schoolmaster Edwin Abbott Abbott.. It is a story about people living in a two dimension world (Only Length and Breadth).. (we all live in a Sphereland .. if you did not get it)..&nbsp;<br /></p>
<p>A free pdf download of the book is below</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/ebooks/download/433567?doc=66038"">https://www.goodreads.com/ebooks/download/433567?doc=66038</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>A Thought Experiment:</b> Bob and Alice live in Flatland, one day morning they come out and look at the sky.. There is this Huge Ball that is coming towards their world, it passes through their world (without injuring them) what would they have seen? Imagine you are Bob or Alice what would you have seen through your eyes?. Let me see if you can express your experience?</p>
<p>Hope you realize how missing one dimension will change the reality?</p>
<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland</a><br /></p>
<p>Is It fair for me to say that in this course assignments (at least in the teams that I mentor) I have seen only a single dimensional view thinking of Insider Threat : i.e<span>&nbsp;Technology Dimensions from the students?</span></p>
<p><span>Just like the in the&nbsp;</span><span>protagonist</span><span>&nbsp;of this story Square, Can We as mentors (Sphere) make you realize the other&nbsp;</span><span>dimensions</span><span>&nbsp;of Insider Threat (Human Legal and Governance)?</span></p>
<p><span>Let me leave you with a Quote from B</span>ruce Schneier</p>
<p><span><i>&quot;If you think <b>technology </b>can solve your security problems, then you don't understand the problems and you don't understand the technology. Bruce Schneier&nbsp;.</i></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Now this is&nbsp;</span><span>especially</span><span>&nbsp;true and amplified in the case of Insider Threat.. While it is easy to be distracted by &quot;Shiny Objects&quot; we call technology.. is it possible to focus on the underlying real dimensions (&nbsp;<span style="""">the root cause<span>&nbsp;)&nbsp;</span></span>?</span></p>","2016-04-24 16:45:55",342,6115,C,3363,D,"Presentation - John Squire",2289,NULL,51
6132,1,CD,"<p>It is a pretty long post but I hope the students take some time to read this, understand this and probably at least discuss the merits or demerits of my arguments when you meet next time.</p>
<p>First, I want you to listen to this TED tak by&nbsp;<span>MacArthur winning Harvard Social Behavior Economist Sendhil Mullainathan taking about solving<span>&nbsp;</span><i><b>Social Problems with a Nudge</b></i><span>&nbsp;</span>through the lens of Behavioral Economics and Human Psychology..&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href=""https://www.ted.com/talks/sendhil_mullainathan?language=en"">https://www.ted.com/talks/sendhil_mullainathan?language=en</a><br /></span></p>
<p>While this is NOT related to Cyber Security and Insider Threat, I want to see if you can listen to this again for a second time with Insider Threat Problem in mind..</p>
<p>Now to do that :</p>
<p><b>DO you agree that Cyber security in large, and Insider Threat is a Social (human) Problem with Economic implications&nbsp;amplified by Technology?</b></p>
<p><b>or Do you truly&nbsp;believe&nbsp;it is Technology Problem amplified by Human Behavior? </b>If anybody has arguments for this I am willing to have an open debate. (But please bring facts and not your opinions, on has malicious human behavior has changed significantly in the last 30 years and how?)</p>
<p><b>Do you agree with this statement from Sendhil?</b></p>
<p><i><i>&lt;quote&gt;&nbsp;</i><span>&nbsp;</span>&quot;Alright, what's the problem? The problem is this little three-pound machine that's behind your eyes and between your ears. This machine is really strange, and one of the consequences is that people are weird. They do lots of inconsistent things. (Applause) They do lots of inconsistent things. And the inconsistencies create, fundamentally, this last mile problem. See, when we were dealing with our biology, bacteria, the genes, the things inside here, the blood (replace the biology part of the sentence with Technology, Cloud, Servers, Applications, Data )? That's complex, but it's manageable. When we're dealing with people like this? The mind is more complex. That's not as manageable, and that's what we're struggling with.&quot;&nbsp;<i>&lt;unquote&gt;</i></i><br /></p>
<p><span>Now if you agree with the above do you agree with his next statement</span><br /></p>
<p><i>&lt;quote&gt;&nbsp;This first challenge is what I refer to as the<span>&nbsp;</span><b>persuasion challenge</b>. Convincing people to do something .... is not an act of information: &quot;Let's give them the data, and when they have data they'll do the right thing.&quot; It's more complex than that. And if you want to understand how it's more complex let me start with something kind of interesting.......&quot;<i>&lt;unquote&gt;</i></i><br /></p>
<p><b>Now as an Insider Threat Expert.. Who Do You Need to Persuade?</b></p>
<p>Now let's look at some data that Bay Dynamics gave me for my talk at RSA 2016: &nbsp;an analysis of a Million Insider threat data they have collected from their platform</p>
<p>1) 90% of Insider threat issues Involve legitimate users who innocently breach corporate Security polices and standards primarily for business purposes.</p>
<p>2) 9-10% of Insider Threat Issues : involve&nbsp;users who are deliberately taking shortcuts&nbsp;and are exhibiting signs of&nbsp;being&nbsp;repeat offenders.</p>
<p><b>3) 1%</b><span>&nbsp;</span>are the critical ones which either show signs of being a malicious or compromised insider<br /></p>
<p>What will you do to persuade #1 and #2 to exhibit the right behavior</p>
<p>Now all four of your course case studies involve #3 the 1% of Insiders who<span>&nbsp;create havoc and make companies loose millions of dollars,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>It takes is only ONE malicious insider or compromised insider inside your company to do this major havoc.</span></span></p>
<p>Obviously you cannot persuade the&nbsp;malicious&nbsp;insider to change his behavior, So As an Insider Threat program expert<span>&nbsp;</span><b>WHO</b><span>&nbsp;</span>do you need to persuade to stop this 1% or this one person in your company ? and Then&nbsp;<b>HOW</b></p>
<p>(let me give you a hint: How about HR and Legal Stakeholders who primarily deal with humans in companies, If you were thinking CIO or IT Department : Sorry Wrong Answer)</p>
<p>I&nbsp;believe&nbsp;this is the<span>&nbsp;</span><b>last mile problem</b><span>&nbsp;</span>that we need to solve.</p>
<p>Now let's see<span>&nbsp;</span><b>HOW</b>?</p>
<p>In my Talk on&nbsp;Cyber-security&nbsp;at Barcelona Spain in 2014, I had quoted Seth Godin</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;A fever is a symptom. There's an underlying disease that causes it. Giving you a fever (sitting in a sauna) doesn't make you sick, and getting rid of the fever (in a cold bath, for example) doesn't always get rid of the illness&hellip; Spending time and money gaming symptoms and effects is common and urgent, but it's often true that you'd be better off focusing on the disease (the cause) instead.&quot;</i><br /></p>
<p>Now coming to your class and your work the last 10 weeks</p>
<p>Hopefully answering these&nbsp;following&nbsp;questions will lead you to the right answers and a good solution (applied&nbsp;in the context of NIST framework) for your presentation..</p>
<p>1) Is your case studies a symptom or is there an underlying<span>&nbsp;</span><i>disease</i><span>&nbsp;</span>for this symptom?&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) is the origin of this&nbsp;<i>disease&nbsp;</i><span>Technology<i>&nbsp;or HUMAN?</i></span></p>
<p><span>3) Are you in this class interested in trying to game the symptom or are you want to unearth the underlying<span>&nbsp;</span><i>disease</i><span>&nbsp;</span>(The Human behind the machine) and address it?</span></p>
<p>4) Do You&nbsp;believe&nbsp;in the<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Cause and Effect</b><span>&nbsp;</span>Theory or Principle?</p>
<p>5) Do you&nbsp;believe&nbsp;removing the cause will take away the effect?</p>
<p>6) Are you&nbsp;familiar&nbsp;with the famous<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Dunning Kruger Effect</b>&nbsp;as a Cognitive Bias ?</p>
<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect</a><br /></p>
<p>I have wondered if If I am seeing the&nbsp;<b>Dunning Kruger Effect</b><span><span>&nbsp;</span>in the CWA program in at least some of the students&nbsp;</span><span>and&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>7) Are the voices of those who&nbsp;understand&nbsp;the true problem getting drowned in the noise of those who don't understand the problem?&nbsp;<span>(at least in the teams &nbsp;that I mentor)</span></span></p>
<p><span>8) Why am I not seeing the Human Behavior&nbsp;Analyst&nbsp;Roles playing a key role in this program ? (at least in the teams &nbsp;that I mentor)</span></p>
<p><span>9) Why is the ISO role not showing leadership and setting the vision and strategy?&nbsp;<span>(at least in the teams &nbsp;that I mentor)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>10) Why is that I don't see the IQ4 platform being used by students to ask REAL questions to the mentors about the insider threat problem and the tasks they have at hand?</span></span></p>
<p><span>In 2015 I wrote a 2 part article on the&nbsp;Illusion&nbsp;of&nbsp;Cyber security in our Internal Blog</span></p>
<p><span><b>Part 1</b>: The Greatest Enemy Of&nbsp;Cyber Security&nbsp;Is Not Ignorance (of&nbsp;Cyber-security); It Is The Illusion Of CyberSecurity</span></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.capgemini.com/blog/capping-it-off/2015/02/illusion-of-cybersecurity"">https://www.capgemini.com/blog/capping-it-off/2015/02/illusion-of-cybersecurity</a><br /></p>
<p><span><b>Part II</b><span>&nbsp;</span>Take away the Cause and the Effect Ceases</span></p>
<p><span><a href=""https://www.capgemini.com/blog/capping-it-off/2015/03/illusion-of-cybersecurity-part-2"">https://www.capgemini.com/blog/capping-it-off/2015/03/illusion-of-cybersecurity-part-2<span>&nbsp;</span></a><br /></span></p>
<p><span>I hope the last 2 posts of mine today in the discussion forums gives you some inspiration for you to focus of the disease and find a real cure for the Insider Threat problem in your Final Presentations</span></p>
<p><span>Good Luck and As always I truly enjoyed teaching this course..</span></p>
<p><span>Will see you in person New York City on May 18th..</span></p>

Personally, when i web-surf, I see many advertisements and for the most part i go along with not clicking them due to the stigma of malware behind them. I did not realize the digital ad fraud was so prevalent in the advertising industry and that companies would lose so much money. I believe that as more things become reliant on computers, the more fraud will happen but I also believe that this would be a great window of opportunity for people to get jobs in this field in terms of cyber security.</p>","2016-04-27 16:24:29",342,6130,C,3366,D,"Digital Fraud is costing media companies $4.5m per HOUR",2376,NULL,53

6178,0,CC,"<p>I found the above advice in the commencement speech and (especially) the op-ed piece on Malia's decision to take the gap year. Personally, I have always been in favor of a gap year. As someone who was actually accepted into Americorps and pulled out last minute due to parental disdain for the &quot;gap,&quot; and then seeing many negative reactions towards Malia's decision, the negative connotation of a gap year in American culture seems prevalent.</p>
<p>The one alternative that I think may be more beneficial than the traditional backpacking through Europe gap or the mission trip to build homes in Africa would be to push these students out of the Eurocentric and stereotypical trips that these gaps tend to encourage. American history education is typically Eurocentric in nature and has a tendency to paint the entire continent of Africa as a barren, war-stricken land that needs saving. While Europe is very culture-rich, and there are developing African countries that need the assistance of volunteers, there are many other countries aren't as often traveled to that can offer an experience and understanding of cultures that otherwise a student may not have the opportunity to.</p>
<p>Being part of a global market, using the &quot;soul-searching&quot; period many students use between high school and college to travel to countries that are rich in cultures that students may not know much about will help them step outside their boundaries and break down constructed subconscious biases that they may have about cultures they are unfamiliar with--potentially making it easier to work effectively with countries with very different cultures and customs from their own and help minimize assumptions that may e made about those unfamiliar cultures.<br /></p>","2016-05-03 01:13:04",342,6160,C,3085,D,"Interesting News in Cyberworld",2400,NULL,53
6179,0,CC,"<p>I feel as the gap year is a very important time in someones life to look and see what they might actually do in their adult life. There has always been a notion you NEED to go to college to have a good life. Yet some get to college and are not sure if they belong there. I know this from first hand experience since even now in my sophomore year I am still contemplating my decision to go to college. It is a difficult time for many high school students and for Malia to take time off and figure out what she wants to do is the best thing she can do at this point in her life.&nbsp;</p>

In general, I do believe that it is relevant to the examination of the insider threat. However, I don't believe that this type of crime deserves an individual title. It seems like it is too specific and employeers should not jump to conclusions regarding Red Collar Crime. Companies can create fear in their new and older employees. At this point, it could create even more hostile working relations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, employee 1 tells employee 2 that she did something illegal and employee 2 threatened to tell. At the end of the day, employee 1 kills employee 2 because she threatened to go to the supervisor. This is really, not any different than other homicide. It involves the use of technology but the goal for killing employee 2 was to keep what employee 1 did a secret. Therefore, I don't understand why it has to be its own category.&nbsp;</p>","2016-05-06 22:39:07",342,6214,C,3368,D,"Red Collar Crime",2341,NULL,53

6232,0,CC,"<p>Your critical push-back is good, and I endorse your continued questioning of whether anything you're presented with is worthwhile or not. &nbsp;And always ask for more when you don't understand.</p>
<p>So .... for your consideration: You offer two main reasons for suggesting red collar crime &nbsp;is unnecessary as a standalone category -- (1) it's not different [enough] from any other form of homicide or battery except for the originating circumstance and motivation; and (2) it could instill or amplify fear and hostility in the workplace.</p>
<p>To the first, 'white collar crime' -- fraud, cybercrime, &nbsp;etc --  induces victims to unwittingly become deprived of dominion over their [or a company's] money or other valuable assets through deceit, artifice, sharp practice, or breach of confidence. It is fundamentally predicated on psychological manipulation. These are crimes of persuasion, committed with a smile not a gun, by stealth not by force.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;But it's a mistake to view these crimes as 'clean' because perpetration itself does not involve violence or physical harm to victims.  It is exceptionally important to expand the category such that everyone -- professionals as well as potential victims -- recognizes that these crimes always involve trauma to the victims -- whether corporate or individual -- and can also asynchronously include violence or physical harm.</p>
<p>Relatedly, as to your other point, the implicit suggestion is that talking about the possibility of an even worse event -- not just theft of assets but maybe also murder! -- is best left alone. What do we discuss and what do we censor or suppress? These questions are important strands of human social relations as well as in institutional culture. They are strictly speaking separate from ethics and compliance, per se.  But they all entwine in how people relate to each other and it matters whether people feel or are authorized to speak -- to each other or to some designated neutral office (ombudsman, for instance) -- about all manner of incendiary or potentially disturbing &nbsp;information.  Acknowledging the potential of violence embedded in an ostensibly non-violent criminal scenario does not in itself manufacture paranoia.  Rather it allows people and organizations to better prepare for possible, even radical, outcomes. We don't shout FIRE in a theatre when there is none; that's not protected speech but illegal incitement.  But we must alert people to possible threats; fire exits are clearly indicated.</p>
<p>In short, NOT talking about something frightening does absolutely nothing to remove the actual threat or lessen the fears themselves.  Institutionalized magical thinking, denial, and avoidance are veritable guaranteed prescriptions for amplifying risks, not diminishing them. <br /></p>

6237,0,CC,"<p style="""">Emma: You bring up an very interesting argument and I would say a compelling one.. Do you need a specific Names for different categories of Crime? I would argue Yes just for the sake of identification.. Just like do humans need any names to function ?, Does &quot;Things&quot; need a name like Phone, TV, Chair? It is good to have names to organize and identify the class of things..</p>
<p style="""">Let's get back to Blue Collar and White Collar Crime.. and do we need another Category called Red Collar Crime?&nbsp;</p>
<p style="""">Traditionally Blue collar crime was done by &quot;Working Class People&quot; and White Collar Crime was done by &quot;Rich Powerful People&quot;..</p>
<p style="""">In 1939 while doing a study of criminology sociologist Edwin Sutherland defined white collar crime as &quot;<i>a crime committed by a person of respectability and high social status in the course of his occupation</i>&quot; that involved Lying, Cheating, and Stealing.. It never involved Physical Violence.. hence the current definition of a White Collar Crime is refers to<span>&nbsp;</span>financially motivated<b> nonviolent crime</b><span>&nbsp;</span>committed by business and government professionals..Now if we add Violence to White Collar Crimes, &nbsp;we now have a choice to create a new category let's say Red Collar Crime..Just like we have Phones and we have SmartPhones..<br /></p>
<p style="""">But I do like your argument .. Do I like the term Red Collar Crime.. Absolutely &nbsp;NOT.. &nbsp;To me in 2016 this no longer has to do with &quot;Collars&quot; or the Color of the Collar !!.. Just like smart Phone is NOT just a Phone, it is much more than that it is a full blown computer that can also make phone calls..</p>

<p>Unfortunately as a mentor it has been very difficult for Dr Stein and me to get this message across to this group of students.. Here it is always about Firewall, networks,data, and technology...There is unquestionable evidence that  <i>&quot;Statistically, 57% of the people leaving a company are taking confidential corporate information with them &quot;</i>..

After reading about ad fraud in another class, advertisements on websites can download malware unknowingly on your computer, even if you don't click on the ad. Since I spend a good amount of time on the internet, I try to stay away from advertisements and avoid clicking on them by personally using an ad blocker. A key thing to do in preventing ad fraud is to not leave websites running on your computer. When a website is open, it shuffles through advertisements on the web page. Some of those ads contain malicious files in which they can just pop up and appear and download malware without you even knowing.

6247,0,CC,"<p>I agree with Alfredo, companies should definitely put more emphasis on communications. Proper communications within a business is very important whether its for prioritizing assets or data or granting/restricting the proper clearance for certain employees. Also, the stakeholders of a company must communicate within the organization in order to determine what resources are available and what assets of the business are vulnerable to an attack. I know within emergency services, communication between organizations is one of the hardest things. That is why the government basically forced organizations to adopt the National Incident Management System (NIMS) to allow for multiple organizations responding to a emergency to uniformly respond to an incident. I believe that in the cyber security world, there should be some type of management system for businesses in which businesses would work together, sharing information with one another about what type of attack they have seen, who the actors were, what did they do to mitigate or prevent future attacks, etc, in order to get a better understanding of the various attacks and what kind of people are enabling them.&nbsp;</p>","2016-05-09 13:17:58",342,6240,C,3369,D,"How Proactivity Improves Cybersecurity Defense",2372,NULL,53

<p><i>&quot;But what about prospective -- eg predictive -- data?&nbsp; Time and again, and again and again, situations in which nobody noticed anything.&nbsp; Until after&quot;.</i></p>
<p />
<p><span style=""""><span>At my RSA talk this year about Insider Threats and Identity&nbsp;Intelligence&nbsp;I said &quot;REAL TIME&quot; Detection of an Insider based attack is too late, early warning and&nbsp;early&nbsp;detection&nbsp;is key, The analogy I &nbsp;gave &nbsp;is similar to Cancer and &nbsp;the cancer society&rsquo;s&nbsp;recommendation&nbsp;of&nbsp;early detection for high risk population (example Mammogram and&nbsp;Prostate testing).. while cancer researchers are searching for&nbsp;can&nbsp;fingerprinting, It is&nbsp;absolutely&nbsp;important for Insider Threat programs &nbsp;to look for Insider misbehavior fingerprinting.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Now coming to the technology aspects of this&nbsp;heist</span></span></p>
<p><span style=""""><span>This is a watershed case for Financial Sector, The MYTH that SWIFT is unhackable has been blown away.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style=""""><span><i><span><span>&quot;SWIFT was not responsible for any of the issues cited by the officials, or party to the related decisions,&quot; it said in a</span></span></i><span><i><span>&nbsp;statement</span></i></span></span></span><i /></p>
<p><span><span><i><span>&quot;As a SWIFT user like any other, Bangladesh Bank is responsible for the security of its own systems interfacing with the SWIFT network and their related environment -- starting with basic password protection practices -- in much the same way as they are responsible for their other internal security considerations.&quot;</span></i></span></span></p>
<p><span>While this is a &quot;politically true&quot; statement, SWIFT should be cognizant of the environment we are living in today, that Security of its own components cannot be&nbsp;delegated&nbsp;to others.</span></p>
<p><span>While doing a security transformation&nbsp;initiative&nbsp;for major&nbsp;Financial Services client in 2012, I had introduced this concept of &quot;Secure by Design&quot;&nbsp;Secure by at Design Time and Secure by Run time and created Security Principles Framework... One of the principle (Principles are directives that MUST not be violated .. A good example of principle in real life is the Ten commandments&quot;)<span>&nbsp; that I had proposed and adopted by the client is below</span></span></p>
<p><b><i><span>Principle Title</span></i></b><i /></p>
<p><span><i><span>Components Protect Themselves&nbsp;</span></i></span></p>
<p><span><b><i><span>Principle Name</span></i></b><i><span> &nbsp;</span></i></span></p>
<p><span><i><span>Information Systems Components must be</span></i><span><i><span>&nbsp;</span></i></span><b><i><span>designed and deployed</span></i></b><span><i><span>&nbsp;</span></i></span><i><span>to protect themselves from current and potential future threats&nbsp;</span></i></span></p>
<p><span><b><i><span>Principle Description</span></i></b></span><i /></p>
<p><span><i><span>When moving to a cloud based architecture and de-perimeterized architectures it is key to ensure that every component is self-protected and every interaction between other components are also protected. The System Design for Cloud should include end point protection, run-time code protection,Message Protection and protection of the data (both at rest and transit in each and every component)</span></i></span></p>
<p><span><b><i><span>Principle Rationale</span></i></b></span><i /></p>
<p><span><i><span>This Principle is very important when adopting Cloud Based Architectures. Even though will have the stand alone principle of Defense in depth, This does not absolve the accountability and responsibility of individual systems to build in-built security when appropriate.&nbsp;</span></i></span></p>
<p><span><b><i><span>Principle Implication</span></i></b></span><i /></p>
<p><span><i><span>This approach is used to mitigate the risk of one component of the defense being compromised or circumvented by helping prevent a short fall in any one defense leading to a wider failure, also known as a &quot;layered approach&quot;. It is key to understand that in a defense in depth approach every system still has the responsibility to apply security principles for the component in scope. the example is even if you have a WAF (web application firewall), all application must be still designed to protect itself from attacks example SQL injection and Cross site scripting by using good input validation routines, every end points in an overall IT system must have built in protection capabilities like &quot;default deny&quot; approach, and every interaction (data flowing between the end points) between the endpoints must be protected example - Message encryption in web services for NPI data.<br /><br /></span></i></span></p>
<p><span>A Corporate INTRANET is&nbsp;</span><span>traditionally</span><span>&nbsp;considered as highly trusted zone, and while lots of effort is put into protecting the perimeter from attacks, the Internal components were left wide open. With advanced intrusion evasion</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>malware</span><span>&nbsp;coupled with Insider Threat, coupled with an insecure legacy component &nbsp;this be comes a deadly combination as seen in the Bank of Bangladesh attack/</span></span></p>
<p><span>A realization by the&nbsp;financial&nbsp;industry&nbsp;&nbsp;that there are no longer <b>trusted boundaries or perimeter</b> would &nbsp;be a good start, and a realization and acceptance by intermediaries like SWIFT would be good start, now that we have seen a &quot;Black Swan&quot; and the myth of SWIFT being unbreakable is blown away. The&nbsp;perimeter&nbsp;of a bank is now inside the pocket of its users and employees and third parties.</span></p>
<p><span><span>If Bank of Bangladesh and SWIFT and Oracle had adopted the &quot;Components must protect themselves&quot; principle, this would not have happened</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Here is very good article with a pictorial&nbsp;</span><span>depictions and technical details of the hack on&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;the various Components that were compromised, please look at the ones that have a spider in them and those components were&nbsp;</span><span>compromised</span><span>..</span></span></p>

For example, get into the tendency of signing out of everything on your computer and cell phone when leaving it unattended.

<ul><li><u><span>Encryption of all nonpublic information held or<br />transmitted</span></u><span>.&nbsp;For in transit data, this requirement is effective one year from the&nbsp;effective date of the regulation.

It requires&nbsp;regulated financial institutions to establish a cybersecurity program; adopt a<br />written cybersecurity policy; designate a Chief Information Security Officer&nbsp;responsible for implementing, overseeing and enforcing its new program and&nbsp;policy; and have policies and procedures designed to ensure the security of&nbsp;information systems and nonpublic information accessible to, or held by,&nbsp;third-parties, along with a variety of other requirements to protect the&nbsp;confidentiality, integrity and availability of information systems.</span></i><i /></p>

The biggest thing that I found interesting were the traditional espionage indicators. Some of the traits here were, &quot;makes jokes or brags about spying&quot;, &quot;working outside of normal duty hours&quot;,&nbsp; &quot;Intrusion into automated information systems. Some of the traits of an insider are serious mental health disorders, personality problems, social skills and decision making deficits, and a history of rule violations. These traits set the ground work for espionage and sabotage cases. Having these traits don't necessarily mean you will commit these crimes what so ever. They have to be aided by things like opportunity, motive, lack of inhibition for betrayal, and a trigger. Together&nbsp;these character flaws lead to things such as violation of physical security policy and procedures, unauthorized web surfing. The fact that these people are insiders makes the risk that much more riskier. As an insider you have access to some things that you may be able to take advantage of thus being a greater threat than an outsider.<br /></p>","2016-09-16 21:22:00",354,6751,C,3571,J,"Week 3 ~ Cyber 101 -- Part 2: Governance, Risk and Compliance",2477,NULL,53

Worse yet, some workers do not follow the rules and protocols that each company has established. For instance, some cases proved that employees have decided to use software that has not been approved by the company. As a result, these employees had been more productive, but all our information has been exposed to hackers. Most of the cases showed that hackers were able to fuse technology with identity theft. In addition, some cases exhibited that employees did not have protocols for workers to access specific files and no others. In other words, roles and responsibilities were not given. The role of an information security officer is not just to protect agency&rsquo;s information. Also, physical security plays a big role, meaning that the ISO should be checking identifications and permissions.

TSL's &quot;heartbeat&quot; protocol would ping the server from the client with a packet of data greater than or equal to zero bytes in size.

So a packet's header could say &quot;this packet contains 10 bits of information,&quot; and the payload could be the string &quot;ABCDEFGHIK.&quot; This payload is received by the server, and its cleartext was placed at the top of the memory heap.

That's still the role some ISOs find themselves in, but the responsibility for many has changed to looking at the big picture and designing the program that balances acceptable risks against the unacceptable. Essentially, the ISO has become a permanent part of the group sitting at the table deciding how the company does business. The ISO leads the security department within the business and that department is now viewed as a necessary function within the business, rather than just being ignored like it used to be. </span><span style="""">Compared to just a few years ago, ISOs now face many challenges and responsibilities that have significantly made their role much harder. Recent security breaches at companies like Target and Sony have placed ISOs on the front line of defense and have attracted significant attention from executives and CEOs. Companies recognize that their ability to confront new cybersecurity threats is driven by how talented their Information Security Officer is and that companies lacking this talent will become increasingly vulnerable.</span></p><p><br /></p><p><span style="""">IT Risk Analyst:</span></p><p><span style=""""> A Risk Analyst is responsible for evaluating and reducing potential risks to the financial well beings of a company or organization. Their job is to examine a company&rsquo;s investment portfolios including overseas investment, and analyze the risk that is involved in associated decisions. Risk Analysis have the responsibilities of protecting data from thefts and setting up parameters to identify individuals that are in potential threads. As a Risk Analyst, we should limit access of certain classified data to prevent any insider threats from the employees who have unlimited access to company&rsquo;s data. Over the years, the definition of risk has changed and includes aspects that in the past have not been considered &ldquo;risks&rdquo;. Due to the changes, company&rsquo;s over the world depend on analysts to build new models and formulas that can keep up with the demand.</span></p><p><br /></p><p><span style=""""> Compliance Analyst: </span></p><p><span style="""">My role as the compliance analyst within the company would be to communicate within different team members to make sure they have the security plan ready if a security breach should occur. My job would also be to make sure all team members are aware of all security procedures and what is appropriate behavior when dealing with the cyber infrastructure. If a breach were to occur my role would to make our companies cyber team work in unison, so we may combat the threat effectively. &nbsp;My role also include effectively communicating what phase of the NIST Framework we are in, so no time or resources are wasted due to miscommunication. As we move from phase to phase I would need to ensure all members are on the same page and no time is being misused. My job would also be responsible for having employees comply to everyday policies and procedures set forth by the company.</span></p><p><br /></p><p><span style="""">Cyber Threat Analyst: </span></p><p><span style=""""><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style="""">The insider threat landscape has changed mostly in the area of wireless vulnerabilities and personal devices usage in the workspace. From the perspective of a Cyber Threat Analyst, monitoring the network for known and unknown devices is essential in a business environment, on the LAN (local area network). Since there are many more personal devices being brought to work and sharing a wireless connection, it becomes a task to distinguish between what&rsquo;s a threat and what isn&rsquo;t; this wasn&rsquo;t such an issue 5 years ago when wireless networks weren&rsquo;t very popular or developed at a commercial level. Wireless technology allows for an easier access to more important intermediate devices such as routers and switches, through packet sniffing. Collecting packets between the default gateway and other, misc. devices is a way to obtain vital information on the company, employees and this leads to several complications. Complications ranging from establishing sessions from obtained passwords, gaining credentials to management devices and MAC spoofing. Again, this wasn&rsquo;t as strong of a threat 5 years ago.</span></p><p><br /></p><p><span style="""">As a cyber threat analysis it is my job to use my cyber intelligence to detect, analyze and respond to vulnerabilities in the moment of a cyber attack. Over the last five years, cyber attacks have continued to grow at an ever increasing volume and severity. Five years ago the government poured most of its money into network security, as stolen credentials was the leading mode of attack. Now, as technology and cyber intelligence rapidly continues to grow, data breaches have worsened and large corporations are now potential victims to severe attacks such as malware, DOS, and advanced persistent threats. Previously cyber threats were happening due to companies often not knowing about the current cyber issues or knowing but chose to ignore the risk associated. Cyber threat analysis, over the last five years, have found easier solutions to attacks using updated tools and softwares. However, even now, sensitive data will always remain vulnerable to attacks and hackers will always find ways to attack. </span></p><p><br /></p><p><span style=""""><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style=""""> </span></p><p><br /></p><p><span style="""">Behavioral Analyst: </span></p><p><span style=""""><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span    style=""""> </span><span    style="""">Behavioral analysts are a team of professionals that provide expertise in the analysis of behavior problems.

This process starts with a baseline and functional assessment that looks at possible factors in the person&rsquo;s environment that may contribute to the behavior occurring. Behavioral analysts will then develop plans based on their findings and train others to give the affected person treatment. Finally, the behavior analyst will evaluate the treatment to determine if it has been successful or unsuccessful. If it&rsquo;s unsuccessful, then as a B.A, we must take further precautions when trying to finding a different, more efficient treatment.

If a job description includes selling credit card accounts, than an employee should be expected to meet this requirement with all available ability.

This could happen myriads of paths, such as practicing selling skills.</span></p><p><br /></p><p><span style="""">By accepting a job, a member sells themselves to an organization to uphold this job requirement.

Its not exactly the same because they weren't fraud employees but to verify my identity the employee asked me questions like &quot;where were you born&quot; &quot;what school did you go to&quot; &quot;what are the last four of your social&quot; etc. While these questions seemed pretty normal I did not answer them for two reasons. One being that I am just giving them free information. How do I know that they even know the answers to the questions they are asking me? I don't. They could just be asking&nbsp;these questions so&nbsp;that they can&nbsp;use them to be verified as me on another account (say my email or phone account since most of these verification questions are universal). I think one way to prevent this from happening is that&nbsp;they should be asking you questions and then providing you with a list of answers where you would have to pick the right one. At least this way you know that they actually do have the answer and aren't just using social engineering to get you to spill info. But on the other hand, this could make it very easy for a hacker to call and narrow down the options to what the representative presents them with.

Even with the degrees employers want certifications and years of experience. I can't remember were I saw the article, it may have been on LinkedIn, but It was saying that the shortage really is that there is not enough people that have the CISSP certification or years experience that employers are looking for. So there are all these graduates that do not have a job and all these security jobs not being filled because of this. In order to get a CISSP certification you need at least 5 years experience in the Security field. Most College graduates do not have that experience to even get the certificate. &nbsp;I'm starting to study for the CISSP certification because it is something I'm finding employees really want on top of the degree and experience.

Not only that, but this attack on Yahoo has been reported as the second biggest data breach by the Breach Level Index Database. Another thing to take note of is that Yahoo is planning on selling their email and internet services to Verizon for $4.83 billion according to the article. Because of the data breach and the years it took to announce such a critical attack, the price Verizon is willing to pay for Yahoo's services may decrease.&nbsp;</p><p>One key lesson you can take from this is that all companies, especially if it's as popular as Yahoo, &nbsp;should have or should now have improved their cyber security and data protection measures while also focusing more on the security aspect of their corporations. They should learn from the year 2014 especially that hackers are willing to attack any company and have the ability to take confidential information from a company.

Not having these courses under your &quot;belt&quot; would otherwise mean immediate dismissal from candidacy. Fortunately, I see no course specific requirements for the Full time MBA and Cyber Security concentration on the MBA website! <br /></p><p>http://graduatebusiness.albany.edu/start-application/</p><p>Furthermore, not all students are limited to a single major! We are all no stranger to how rigorous medical school acceptances are, which would encourage the idea of dual or more majors. Once again Ryan, maybe entertain the idea of a minor in I.T. or Comp. Sci. if you're able to! Having that blend of education background would grant you access to specialized fields! In the case of music and healthcare, there is music therapy which has been exponentially growing in popularity according to the the American Music Therapy Association's home page!</p><p>http://www.musictherapy.org/about/quotes/</p><p>With regards to criminal justice and cyber security, we can see from our readings that federal organizations always give preference to individuals with millitary, law, policing, etc. backgrounds with relevant I.T. knowledge! I will try and find the exact quote from the reading that states this.&nbsp; I would argue, similar to how I stated in my original comment, that cross training is going to be key to you're success Ryan! <br /></p><p>Finally not so much to Ryan, music is an extremely large category of education. Education majors&nbsp; can concentrate on music education or music history for example, while other majors can focus on management (bushiness) of music production or the (I.T.)technology that creates it! I apologize for claiming specifically music declared majors made up those statistics, and not the academic paths that are focused on music.
